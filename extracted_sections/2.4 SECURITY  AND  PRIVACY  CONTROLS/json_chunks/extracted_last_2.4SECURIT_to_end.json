Depending on the circumstances, these objectives and risks can be independent or b\noverlapping. Federal information security programs are responsible for protecting information\nand information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or e\nfdestruction (i.e., unauthorized activity or system behavior) to provide confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability. Those programs are also responsible for managing security risk and for ensuring a\necompliance with applicable security requirements. Federal privacy programs are responsible for\nomanaging risks to individuals associated with the creation, collection, use, processing, storage,\n:maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, or disposal (collectively referred to as \u201cprocessing\u201d) of\nt28 When a system PII and for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy requirements.p\n/processes PII, the information security program and the privacy program have a shared /\nresponsibility for managing the security risks for the PII in the system. Due to this overlap in i.\ngresponsibilities, the controls that organizations select to manage these security risks will\n0generally be the same regardless of their designation as security or privacy controls in control\nbaselines or program or system plans.\nSThere also may be circumstances in which the selection and/or implementation of the control or\nScontrol enhancement affects the ability of a program to achieve its objectives and manage its\nrespective risks. The control discussion section may highlight specific security and/or privacy 8\nconsiderations so that organizations can take these considerations into account as they -\ndetermine the most effective method to implement the control. However, these considerations r\nare not exhaustive.\n(Content of Audit Records) to support For example, an organization might select AU-3\nmonitoring for unauthorized access to an information asset that does not include PII. Since the\n28 Privacy programs may also choose to consider the risks to individuals that may arise from their interactions with\ninformation systems, where the processing of personally identifiable information may be less impactful than the\neffect that the system has on individuals\u2019 behavior or activities. Such effects would constitute risks to individual\nautonomy, and organizations may need to take steps to manage those risks in addition to information security and\nprivacy risks.\nCHAPTER TWO  PAGE 13"
