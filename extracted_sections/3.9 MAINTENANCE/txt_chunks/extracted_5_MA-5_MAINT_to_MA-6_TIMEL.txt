aMA-5 MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL
Control:   is
va.Establish a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintain a list of
lauthorized maintenance organizations or personnel; a
b.Verify that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance on the system possess the  f
erequired access authorizations; and
cc.Designate organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical
competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the r
required access authorizations.
Discussion:  Maintenance personnel refers to individuals who perform hardware or software
maintenance on organizational systems, while PE-2 addresses physical access for individuals
swhose maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the systems.
dTechnical competence of supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the
i.systems, while having required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the
systems. Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel—such as
0information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants—may
0require privileged access to organizational systems, such as when they are required to conduct
maintenance activities with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, /
Iorganizations may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may S
.be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.

5Control Enhancements:
| (1) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL  INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT APPROPRIATE ACCESS
(a)Implement procedures for the use of maintenance personnel that lack appropriate
security clearances or are not U.S. citizens, that include the following requirements:
(1)Maintenance personnel who do not have needed access authorizations,
clearances, or formal access approvals are escorted and supervised during the
performance of maintenance and diagnostic activities on the system by approved
organizational personnel who are fully cleared, have appropriate access
authorizations, and are technically qualified; and
(2)Prior to initiating maintenance or diagnostic activities by personnel who do not
have needed access authorizations, clearances or formal access approvals, all

volatile information storage components within the system are sanitized and all
nonvolatile storage media are removed or physically disconnected from the
system and secured; and
Assignment: organization-defined alternate controls(b)Develop and implement [] in the
event a system component cannot be sanitized, removed, or disconnected from the
system.
Discussion:  Procedures for individuals who lack appropriate security clearances or who are
not U.S. citizens are intended to deny visual and electronic access to classified or controlled
unclassified information contained on organizational systems. Procedures for the use of
maintenance personnel can be documented in security plans for the systems.
Related Controls:  MP-6, PL-2.
|  (2) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL  SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR CLASSIFIED SYSTEMS
isVerify that personnel performing maintenance and diagnostic activities on a system
uprocessing, storing, or transmitting classified information possess security clearances and
liformal access approvals for at least the highest classification level and for compartments c
tof information on the system. i
Discussion:  Personnel who conduct maintenance on organizational systems may be exposed is
to classified information during the course of their maintenance activities. To mitigate the
iinherent risk of such exposure, organizations use maintenance personnel that are cleared la
(i.e., possess security clearances) to the classification level of the information stored on the le
fsystem. r

| (3) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL  CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS FOR CLASSIFIED SYSTEMS a
eVerify that personnel performing maintenance and diagnostic activities on a system
oprocessing, storing, or transmitting classified information are U.S. citizens.
Discussion:  Personnel who conduct maintenance on organizational systems may be exposed
tto classified information during the course of their maintenance activities. If access to p
classified information on organizational systems is restricted to U.S. citizens, the same /
orestriction is applied to personnel performing maintenance on those systems.

Ensure that: 8
I(a)Foreign nationals with appropriate security clearances are used to conduct  S
maintenance and diagnostic activities on classified systems only when the systems are .
jointly owned and operated by the United States and foreign allied governments, or
0owned and operated solely by foreign allied governments; and
(b)Approvals, consents, and detailed operational conditions regarding the use of foreign  3
nationals to conduct maintenance and diagnostic activities on classified systems are
fully documented within Memoranda of Agreements.
Discussion:  Personnel who conduct maintenance and diagnostic activities on organizational
systems may be exposed to classified information. If non-U.S. citizens are permitted to
perform maintenance and diagnostics activities on classified systems, then additional vetting
is required to ensure agreements and restrictions are not being violated.

Ensure that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance activities not directly
associated with the system but in the physical proximity of the system, have required
access authorizations.
Discussion:  Personnel who perform maintenance activities in other capacities not directly
related to the system include physical plant personnel and custodial personnel.
