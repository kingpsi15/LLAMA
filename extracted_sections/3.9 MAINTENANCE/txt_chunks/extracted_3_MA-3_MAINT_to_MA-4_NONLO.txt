Assignment: organization-defined b.Review previously approved system maintenance tools [
frequency].
Discussion:  Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools address
security-related issues associated with maintenance tools that are not within system
authorization boundaries and are used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on
organizational systems. Organizations have flexibility in determining roles for the approval of
maintenance tools and how that approval is documented. A periodic review of maintenance
tools facilitates the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-
used tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items and may be
pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media, cloud-based, or downloaded
from a website. Such tools can be vehicles for transporting malicious code, either intentionally or
unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems. Maintenance tools can include
hardware and software diagnostic test equipment and packet sniffers. The hardware and T
isoftware components that support maintenance and are a part of the system (including the s
software implementing utilities such as “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,” or the hardware and software u
limplementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch) are not addressed by maintenance ic
ttools.

aControl Enhancements:
l|  (1) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  INSPECT TOOLSe
eInspect the maintenance tools used by maintenance personnel for improper or
ounauthorized modifications.
hDiscussion:  Maintenance tools can be directly brought into a facility by maintenance
gpersonnel or downloaded from a vendor’s website. If, upon inspection of the maintenance
ftools, organizations determine that the tools have been modified in an improper manner or r
the tools contain malicious code, the incident is handled consistent with organizational
policies and procedures for incident handling.
Related Controls:  SI-7. :
| (2)i MAINTENANCE TOOLS  INSPECT MEDIA .
Check media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media
are used in the system.
Discussion:  If, upon inspection of media containing maintenance, diagnostic, and test 2
programs, organizations determine that the media contains malicious code, the incident is N
handled consistent with organizational incident handling policies and procedures.
Related Controls:  SI-3. P
| (3) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED REMOVAL 0
3Prevent the removal of maintenance equipment containing organizational information by:
(a)Verifying that there is no organizational information contained on the equipment;
(b)Sanitizing or destroying the equipment;
(c)Retaining the equipment within the facility; or
Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles(d)Obtaining an exemption from []
explicitly authorizing removal of the equipment from the facility.
Discussion:  Organizational information includes all information owned by organizations and
any information provided to organizations for which the organizations serve as information
stewards.
Related Controls:  MP-6.

| (4) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  RESTRICTED TOOL USE
Restrict the use of maintenance tools to authorized personnel only.
Discussion:  Restricting the use of maintenance tools to only authorized personnel applies to
systems that are used to carry out maintenance functions.
Related Controls:  AC-3, AC-5, AC-6.
| (5) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  EXECUTION WITH PRIVILEGE
Monitor the use of maintenance tools that execute with increased privilege.
Discussion:  Maintenance tools that execute with increased system privilege can result in
unauthorized access to organizational information and assets that would otherwise be
inaccessible.
Related Controls:  AC-3, AC-6.
is| (6) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  SOFTWARE UPDATES AND PATCHES
bInspect maintenance tools to ensure the latest software updates and patches are installed.
Discussion:  Maintenance tools using outdated and/or unpatched software can provide a
threat vector for adversaries and result in a significant vulnerability for organizations. n
