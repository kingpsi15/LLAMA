MA-6 TIMELY MAINTENANCE
Assignment: organization-defined Control:  Obtain maintenance support and/or spare parts for [
system componentsAssignment: organization-defined time period] within [] of failure.
hDiscussion:  Organizations specify the system components that result in increased risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation when the p
bfunctionality provided by those components is not operational. Organizational actions to obtain
maintenance support include having appropriate contracts in place. a

componentsAssignment: organization-defined time intervals] at [].
cDiscussion:  Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and the servicing of system
components to maintain organizational equipment and facilities in satisfactory operating r
condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic inspection, tests, measurements,
adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before  m
:they occur or before they develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive
tmaintenance is to avoid or mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive p
:maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn /
ocomponents before they fail. Methods of determining what preventive (or other) failure
management policies to apply include original equipment manufacturer recommendations; r
1statistical failure records; expert opinion; maintenance that has already been conducted on
6similar equipment; requirements of codes, laws, or regulations within a jurisdiction; or
measured values and performance indications.

S| (2) TIMELY MAINTENANCE  PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE
Assignment: organization-defined system Perform predictive maintenance on [
componentsAssignment: organization-defined time intervals-] at [].
rDiscussion:  Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing 5
periodic or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive
maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled time when the maintenance activity
is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. The
predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the objective of predicting the
future trend of the equipment's condition. The predictive maintenance approach employs
principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance
activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while
equipment is in service, thus minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive
maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability.

Discussion:  A computerized maintenance management system maintains a database of
information about the maintenance operations of organizations and automates the
processing of equipment condition data to trigger maintenance planning, execution, and
reporting.
