Control: f
a.Approve and monitor nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;  r
fb.Allow the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent with  r
organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the system;
tc.Employ strong authentication in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic  p
:sessions; /
id.Maintain records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and  .
e.Terminate session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.      1
0Discussion:  Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals who
communicate through either an external or internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic
Iactivities are carried out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not S
communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used to establish .
IA-2. nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in
0Strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ
5multi-factor authentication. Strong authenticators include PKI where certificates are stored on a

accomplished, in part, by other controls. [SP 800-63B] provides additional guidance on strong
authentication and authenticators.

| (3) NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE  COMPARABLE SECURITY AND SANITIZATION
(a)Require that nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic services be performed from a
system that implements a security capability comparable to the capability
implemented on the system being serviced; or
i(b)Remove the component to be serviced from the system prior to nonlocal maintenance  s
or diagnostic services; sanitize the component (for organizational information); and u
lafter the service is performed, inspect and sanitize the component (for potentially ic
malicious software) before reconnecting the component to the system. t
Discussion:  Comparable security capability on systems, diagnostic tools, and equipment
aproviding maintenance services implies that the implemented controls on those systems,
tools, and equipment are at least as comprehensive as the controls on the system being i
bserviced.

access during remote maintenance sessions can result in a variety of hostile actions,
including malicious code insertion, unauthorized changes to system parameters, and
exfiltration of organizational information. Such actions can result in the loss or degradation
of mission or business capabilities.

|  (7) NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE  DISCONNECT VERIFICATION
Verify session and network connection termination after the completion of nonlocal
maintenance and diagnostic sessions.
Discussion:  Verifying the termination of a connection once maintenance is completed
ensures that connections established during nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions
have been terminated and are no longer available for use.
