Local maintenance and diagnostic\nIactivities are carried out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not S\ncommunicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used to establish .\nIA-2. nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in\n0Strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ\n5multi-factor authentication.
