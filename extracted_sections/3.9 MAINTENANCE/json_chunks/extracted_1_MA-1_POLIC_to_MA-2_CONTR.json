The risk management strategy is an important d\nifactor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security .\ngand privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate\n0on the development of maintenance policy and procedures. Security and privacy program\npolicies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the 0\n8need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part\nIof the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the\ncomplex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy .\nprograms, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe\n0how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is\nthe object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans 5\nor in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to maintenance 5\npolicy and procedures assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in\napplicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\nSimply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 162\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
