Organizational actions to obtain\nmaintenance support include having appropriate contracts in place. a\nRelated Controls:  CM-8, CP-2, CP-7, RA-7, SA-15, SI-13, SR-2, SR-3, SR-4.\nvControl Enhancements:\nb| (1) TIMELY MAINTENANCE  PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE\nfAssignment: organization-defined system Perform preventive maintenance on [r\ncomponentsAssignment: organization-defined time intervals] at [].\ncDiscussion:  Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and the servicing of system\ncomponents to maintain organizational equipment and facilities in satisfactory operating r\ncondition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic inspection, tests, measurements,\nadjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before  m\n:they occur or before they develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive\ntmaintenance is to avoid or mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive p\n:maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn /\nocomponents before they fail. Methods of determining what preventive (or other) failure\nmanagement policies to apply include original equipment manufacturer recommendations; r\n1statistical failure records; expert opinion; maintenance that has already been conducted on\n6similar equipment; requirements of codes, laws, or regulations within a jurisdiction; or\nmeasured values and performance indications.\nRelated Controls:  None. I\nS| (2) TIMELY MAINTENANCE  PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE\nAssignment: organization-defined system Perform predictive maintenance on [\ncomponentsAssignment: organization-defined time intervals-] at [].\nrDiscussion:  Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing 5\nperiodic or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive\nmaintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled time when the maintenance activity\nis most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. The\npredictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the objective of predicting the\nfuture trend of the equipment's condition. The predictive maintenance approach employs\nprinciples of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance\nactivities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while\nequipment is in service, thus minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive\nmaintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 169\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n| (3) TIMELY MAINTENANCE  AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE\nTransfer predictive maintenance data to a maintenance management system using\nAssignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms[].\nDiscussion:  A computerized maintenance management system maintains a database of\ninformation about the maintenance operations of organizations and automates the\nprocessing of equipment condition data to trigger maintenance planning, execution, and\nreporting.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None."
