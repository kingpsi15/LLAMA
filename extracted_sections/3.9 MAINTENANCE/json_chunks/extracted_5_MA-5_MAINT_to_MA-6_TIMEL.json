Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel\u2014such as\n0information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants\u2014may\n0require privileged access to organizational systems, such as when they are required to conduct\nmaintenance activities with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, /\nIorganizations may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may S\n.be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.\n8Related Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-6, IA-2, IA-8, MA-4, MP-2, PE-2, PE-3, PS-7, RA-3.\n5Control Enhancements:\n| (1) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL  INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT APPROPRIATE ACCESS\n(a)Implement procedures for the use of maintenance personnel that lack appropriate\nsecurity clearances or are not U.S. citizens, that include the following requirements:\n(1)Maintenance personnel who do not have needed access authorizations,\nclearances, or formal access approvals are escorted and supervised during the\nperformance of maintenance and diagnostic activities on the system by approved\norganizational personnel who are fully cleared, have appropriate access\nauthorizations, and are technically qualified; and\n(2)Prior to initiating maintenance or diagnostic activities by personnel who do not\nhave needed access authorizations, clearances or formal access approvals, all\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 167\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nvolatile information storage components within the system are sanitized and all\nnonvolatile storage media are removed or physically disconnected from the\nsystem and secured; and\nAssignment: organization-defined alternate controls(b)Develop and implement [] in the\nevent a system component cannot be sanitized, removed, or disconnected from the\nsystem.\nDiscussion:  Procedures for individuals who lack appropriate security clearances or who are\nnot U.S. citizens are intended to deny visual and electronic access to classified or controlled\nunclassified information contained on organizational systems. Procedures for the use of\nmaintenance personnel can be documented in security plans for the systems.\nRelated Controls:  MP-6, PL-2.\n|  (2) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL  SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR CLASSIFIED SYSTEMS\nisVerify that personnel performing maintenance and diagnostic activities on a system\nuprocessing, storing, or transmitting classified information possess security clearances and\nliformal access approvals for at least the highest classification level and for compartments c\ntof information on the system. i\nDiscussion:  Personnel who conduct maintenance on organizational systems may be exposed is\nto classified information during the course of their maintenance activities. To mitigate the\niinherent risk of such exposure, organizations use maintenance personnel that are cleared la\n(i.e., possess security clearances) to the classification level of the information stored on the le\nfsystem. r\nRelated Controls:  PS-3. o\n| (3) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL  CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS FOR CLASSIFIED SYSTEMS a\neVerify that personnel performing maintenance and diagnostic activities on a system\noprocessing, storing, or transmitting classified information are U.S. citizens.\nDiscussion:  Personnel who conduct maintenance on organizational systems may be exposed\ntto classified information during the course of their maintenance activities. If access to p\nclassified information on organizational systems is restricted to U.S. citizens, the same /\norestriction is applied to personnel performing maintenance on those systems.\nRelated Controls:  PS-3. g\n.|  (4) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL  FOREIGN NATIONALS6\nEnsure that: 8\nI(a)Foreign nationals with appropriate security clearances are used to conduct  S\nmaintenance and diagnostic activities on classified systems only when the systems are .\njointly owned and operated by the United States and foreign allied governments, or\n0owned and operated solely by foreign allied governments; and\n(b)Approvals, consents, and detailed operational conditions regarding the use of foreign  3\nnationals to conduct maintenance and diagnostic activities on classified systems are\nfully documented within Memoranda of Agreements.\nDiscussion:  Personnel who conduct maintenance and diagnostic activities on organizational\nsystems may be exposed to classified information. If non-U.S. citizens are permitted to\nperform maintenance and diagnostics activities on classified systems, then additional vetting\nis required to ensure agreements and restrictions are not being violated.\nRelated Controls:  PS-3.\n|- (5) MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL  NONSYSTEM MAINTENANCE\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 168\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEnsure that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance activities not directly\nassociated with the system but in the physical proximity of the system, have required\naccess authorizations.\nDiscussion:  Personnel who perform maintenance activities in other capacities not directly\nrelated to the system include physical plant personnel and custodial personnel.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None."
