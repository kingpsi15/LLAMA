Organizations have flexibility in determining roles for the approval of\nmaintenance tools and how that approval is documented. A periodic review of maintenance\ntools facilitates the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-\nused tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items and may be\npre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media, cloud-based, or downloaded\nfrom a website. Such tools can be vehicles for transporting malicious code, either intentionally or\nunintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems. Maintenance tools can include\nhardware and software diagnostic test equipment and packet sniffers. The hardware and T\nisoftware components that support maintenance and are a part of the system (including the s\nsoftware implementing utilities such as \u201cping,\u201d \u201cls,\u201d \u201cipconfig,\u201d or the hardware and software u\nlimplementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch) are not addressed by maintenance ic\nttools.\niRelated Controls:  MA-2, PE-16. s\naControl Enhancements:\nl|  (1) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  INSPECT TOOLSe\neInspect the maintenance tools used by maintenance personnel for improper or\nounauthorized modifications.\nhDiscussion:  Maintenance tools can be directly brought into a facility by maintenance\ngpersonnel or downloaded from a vendor\u2019s website. If, upon inspection of the maintenance\nftools, organizations determine that the tools have been modified in an improper manner or r\nthe tools contain malicious code, the incident is handled consistent with organizational\npolicies and procedures for incident handling.\nRelated Controls:  SI-7. :\n| (2)i MAINTENANCE TOOLS  INSPECT MEDIA .\nCheck media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media\nare used in the system.\nDiscussion:  If, upon inspection of media containing maintenance, diagnostic, and test 2\nprograms, organizations determine that the media contains malicious code, the incident is N\nhandled consistent with organizational incident handling policies and procedures.\nRelated Controls:  SI-3. P\n| (3) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED REMOVAL 0\n3Prevent the removal of maintenance equipment containing organizational information by:\n(a)Verifying that there is no organizational information contained on the equipment;\n(b)Sanitizing or destroying the equipment;\n(c)Retaining the equipment within the facility; or\nAssignment: organization-defined personnel or roles(d)Obtaining an exemption from []\nexplicitly authorizing removal of the equipment from the facility.\nDiscussion:  Organizational information includes all information owned by organizations and\nany information provided to organizations for which the organizations serve as information\nstewards.\nRelated Controls:  MP-6.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 164\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n| (4) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  RESTRICTED TOOL USE\nRestrict the use of maintenance tools to authorized personnel only.\nDiscussion:  Restricting the use of maintenance tools to only authorized personnel applies to\nsystems that are used to carry out maintenance functions.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-5, AC-6.\n| (5) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  EXECUTION WITH PRIVILEGE\nMonitor the use of maintenance tools that execute with increased privilege.\nDiscussion:  Maintenance tools that execute with increased system privilege can result in\nunauthorized access to organizational information and assets that would otherwise be\ninaccessible.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-6.\nis| (6) MAINTENANCE TOOLS  SOFTWARE UPDATES AND PATCHES\nbInspect maintenance tools to ensure the latest software updates and patches are installed.\nDiscussion:  Maintenance tools using outdated and/or unpatched software can provide a\nthreat vector for adversaries and result in a significant vulnerability for organizations. n\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-6. a\nlReferences:  [SP 800-88]. a"
