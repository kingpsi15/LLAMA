control selection process can be part of an organization-wide risk management process, a
13 the Risk Management Framework [SP 800-37], systems engineering process [SP 800-160-1],
14the Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF], or the Privacy Framework [NIST PF]. The control
selection criteria can be guided and informed by many factors, including mission and business
needs, stakeholder protection needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and requirements to comply with
federal laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. The
combination of a catalog of security and privacy controls and a risk-based control selection
process can help organizations comply with stated security and privacy requirements, obtain
adequate security for their information systems, and protect the privacy of individuals.

1.3ORGANIZATIONALRESPONSIBILITIES     P
0Managing security and privacy risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires:
•5Well-defined security and privacy requirements for systems and organizations;
•The use of trustworthy information system components based on state-of-the-practice
hardware, firmware, and software development and acquisition processes;
13 Risk management is an integral part of systems engineering, systems security engineering, and privacy engineering.
14 [OMB A-130] requires federal agencies to implement the NIST Risk Management Framework for the selection of
Framework for controls for federal information systems. [EO 13800] requires federal agencies to implement the NIST
Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity to manage cybersecurity risk. The NIST frameworks are also available
to nonfederal organizations as optional resources.

•Rigorous security and privacy planning and system development life cycle management;
•The application of system security and privacy engineering principles and practices to
securely develop and integrate system components into information systems;
•The employment of security and privacy practices that are properly documented and
integrated into and supportive of the institutional and operational processes of
organizations; and
•Continuous monitoring of information systems and organizations to determine the ongoing
effectiveness of controls, changes in information systems and environments of operation,
and the state of security and privacy organization-wide.
TOrganizations continuously assess the security and privacy risks to organizational operations and
isassets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Security and privacy risks arise from the
planning and execution of organizational mission and business functions, placing information
systems into operation, or continuing system operations. Realistic assessments of risk require a
othorough understanding of the susceptibility to threats based on the specific vulnerabilities in
isinformation systems and organizations and the likelihood and potential adverse impacts of
v15 Risk assessments also require successful exploitations of such vulnerabilities by those threats.
la16an understanding of privacy risks.
To address the organization’s concerns about assessment and determination of risk, security
and privacy requirements are satisfied with the knowledge and understanding of the f
h17organizational risk management strategy. The risk management strategy considers the cost,
schedule, performance, and supply chain issues associated with the design, development,
racquisition, deployment, operation, sustainment, and disposal of organizational systems. A risk
18management process is then applied to manage risk on an ongoing basis. :
The catalog of security and privacy controls can be effectively used to protect organizations, :
oindividuals, and information systems from traditional and advanced persistent threats and
privacy risks arising from the processing of personally identifiable information (PII) in varied r
operational, environmental, and technical scenarios. The controls can be used to demonstrate
compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security and privacy 0
