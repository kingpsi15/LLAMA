The control\nselection criteria can be guided and informed by many factors, including mission and business\nneeds, stakeholder protection needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and requirements to comply with\nfederal laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. The\ncombination of a catalog of security and privacy controls and a risk-based control selection\nprocess can help organizations comply with stated security and privacy requirements, obtain\nadequate security for their information systems, and protect the privacy of individuals.\n1.2TARGETAUDIENCE\nThis publication is intended to serve a diverse audience, including:\nl\u2022Individuals with system, information security, privacy, or risk management and oversight i c\ntresponsibilities, including authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior agency i\ninformation security officers, and senior agency officials for privacy; is\n\u2022Individuals with system development responsibilities, including mission owners, program  a\nmanagers, system engineers, system security engineers, privacy engineers, hardware and b\nsoftware developers, system integrators, and acquisition or procurement officials; f\n\u2022o Individuals with logistical or disposition-related responsibilities, including program\nhmanagers, procurement officials, system integrators, and property managers;\ne\u2022Individuals with security and privacy implementation and operations responsibilities,\nincluding mission or business owners, system owners, information owners or stewards,  m\nsystem administrators, continuity planners, and system security or privacy officers; h\n\u2022Individuals with security and privacy assessment and monitoring responsibilities, including  :\nauditors, Inspectors General, system evaluators, control assessors, independent verifiers o\nand validators, and analysts; and r\n\u2022Commercial entities, including industry partners, producing component products and  .\nsystems, creating security and privacy technologies, or providing services or capabilities that 2\nNsupport information security or privacy.\n1.3ORGANIZATIONALRESPONSIBILITIES     P\n0Managing security and privacy risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires:\n\u20225Well-defined security and privacy requirements for systems and organizations;\n\u2022The use of trustworthy information system components based on state-of-the-practice\nhardware, firmware, and software development and acquisition processes;\n13 Risk management is an integral part of systems engineering, systems security engineering, and privacy engineering.\n14 [OMB A-130] requires federal agencies to implement the NIST Risk Management Framework for the selection of\nFramework for controls for federal information systems. [EO 13800] requires federal agencies to implement the NIST\nImproving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity to manage cybersecurity risk. The NIST frameworks are also available\nto nonfederal organizations as optional resources.\nCHAPTER ONE  PAGE3\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u2022Rigorous security and privacy planning and system development life cycle management;\n\u2022The application of system security and privacy engineering principles and practices to\nsecurely develop and integrate system components into information systems;\n\u2022The employment of security and privacy practices that are properly documented and\nintegrated into and supportive of the institutional and operational processes of\norganizations; and\n\u2022Continuous monitoring of information systems and organizations to determine the ongoing\neffectiveness of controls, changes in information systems and environments of operation,\nand the state of security and privacy organization-wide.\nTOrganizations continuously assess the security and privacy risks to organizational operations and\nisassets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Security and privacy risks arise from the\nplanning and execution of organizational mission and business functions, placing information\nsystems into operation, or continuing system operations. Realistic assessments of risk require a\nothorough understanding of the susceptibility to threats based on the specific vulnerabilities in\nisinformation systems and organizations and the likelihood and potential adverse impacts of\nv15 Risk assessments also require successful exploitations of such vulnerabilities by those threats.\nla16an understanding of privacy risks.\nTo address the organization\u2019s concerns about assessment and determination of risk, security\nand privacy requirements are satisfied with the knowledge and understanding of the f\nh17organizational risk management strategy. The risk management strategy considers the cost,\nschedule, performance, and supply chain issues associated with the design, development,\nracquisition, deployment, operation, sustainment, and disposal of organizational systems. A risk\n18management process is then applied to manage risk on an ongoing basis. :\nThe catalog of security and privacy controls can be effectively used to protect organizations, :\noindividuals, and information systems from traditional and advanced persistent threats and\nprivacy risks arising from the processing of personally identifiable information (PII) in varied r\noperational, environmental, and technical scenarios. The controls can be used to demonstrate\ncompliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security and privacy 0\n8requirements. Organizations have the responsibility to select the appropriate security and\nIprivacy controls, to implement the controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of S\n19.the controls in satisfying security and privacy requirements. Security and privacy controls can S\nbaselinesoverlaysalso be used in developing specialized  or  for unique or specialized missions or .\n0business applications, information systems, threat concerns, operational environments,\n203 technologies, or communities of interest.\n15 [SP 800-30] provides guidance on the risk assessment process.\n16 [IR 8062] introduces privacy risk concepts.\n17 [SP 800-39] provides guidance on risk management processes and strategies.\n18 [SP 800-37] provides a comprehensive risk management process.\n19 [SP 800-53A] provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of controls.\n20 [SP 800-53B] provides guidance for tailoring security and privacy control baselines and for developing overlays to\nsupport the specific protection needs and requirements of stakeholders and their organizations.\nCHAPTER ONE  PAGE4"
