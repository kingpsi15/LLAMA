The controls are designed to facilitate risk management and\ncompliance with applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and\nstandards. With few exceptions, the security and privacy controls in the catalog are policy-,\ntechnology-, and sector-neutral, meaning that the controls focus on the fundamental measures\nnecessary to protect information and the privacy of individuals across the information life cycle.\nhWhile the security and privacy controls are largely policy-, technology-, and sector-neutral, that\ndoes not imply that the controls are policy-, technology-, and sector-unaware. Understanding p\npolicies, technologies, and sectors is necessary so that the controls are relevant when they are lic\nimplemented. Employing a policy-, technology-, and sector-neutral control catalog has many t\nbenefits. It encourages organizations to:\n\u2022vFocus on the security and privacy functions and capabilities required for mission and\nlabusiness success and the protection of information and the privacy of individuals,\nleirrespective of the technologies that are employed in organizational systems;\n\u2022Analyze each security and privacy control for its applicability to specific technologies,\nenvironments of operation, mission and business functions, and communities of interest; c\nand r\n\u2022rSpecify security and privacy policies as part of the tailoring process for controls that have\nvariable parameters. :\nIn the few cases where specific technologies are referenced in controls, organizations are :\nocautioned that the need to manage security and privacy risks may go beyond the requirements\nin a single control associated with a technology. The additional needed protection measures are r\n, obtained from the other controls in the catalog. Federal Information Processing Standards\nSpecial Publications, and Interagency/Internal Reports provide guidance on selecting security 0\n8and privacy controls that reduce risk for specific technologies and sector-specific applications,\nIincluding smart grid, cloud, healthcare, mobile, industrial control systems, and Internet of Things S\n33. NIST publications are cited as references as applicable to specific controls in (IoT) devices.S\nSections 3.1 through 3.20. .\nSecurity and privacy controls in the catalog are expected to change over time as controls are 3\nwithdrawn, revised, and added. To maintain stability in security and privacy plans, controls are\nnot renumbered each time a control is withdrawn. Rather, notations of the controls that have\nbeen withdrawn are maintained in the control catalog for historical purposes. Controls may be\nwithdrawn for a variety of reasons, including when the function or capability provided by the\ncontrol has been incorporated into another control, the control is redundant to an existing\ncontrol, or the control is deemed to be no longer necessary or effective.\n32 The controls in this publication are available online and can be obtained in various formats. See [NVD 800-53].\n33 For example, [SP 800-82] provides guidance on risk management and control selection for industrial control\nsystems.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 16\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nNew controls are developed on a regular basis using threat and vulnerability information and\ninformation on the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by adversaries. In addition, new\ncontrols are developed based on a better understanding of how to mitigate information security\nrisks to systems and organizations and risks to the privacy of individuals arising from information\nprocessing. Finally, new controls are developed based on new or changing requirements in laws,\nexecutive orders, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines. Proposed modifications to the\ncontrols are carefully analyzed during each revision cycle, considering the need for stability of\ncontrols and the need to be responsive to changing technologies, threats, vulnerabilities, types\nof attack, and processing methods. The objective is to adjust the level of information security\nand privacy over time to meet the needs of organizations and individuals.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 17"
