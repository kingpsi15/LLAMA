SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS AND CONTROL ENHANCEMENTS
This catalog of security and privacy controls provides protective measures for systems,
32organizations, and individuals. The controls are designed to facilitate risk management and
compliance with applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and
standards. With few exceptions, the security and privacy controls in the catalog are policy-,
technology-, and sector-neutral, meaning that the controls focus on the fundamental measures
necessary to protect information and the privacy of individuals across the information life cycle.
hWhile the security and privacy controls are largely policy-, technology-, and sector-neutral, that
does not imply that the controls are policy-, technology-, and sector-unaware. Understanding p
policies, technologies, and sectors is necessary so that the controls are relevant when they are lic
implemented. Employing a policy-, technology-, and sector-neutral control catalog has many t
benefits. It encourages organizations to:
•vFocus on the security and privacy functions and capabilities required for mission and
labusiness success and the protection of information and the privacy of individuals,
leirrespective of the technologies that are employed in organizational systems;
•Analyze each security and privacy control for its applicability to specific technologies,
environments of operation, mission and business functions, and communities of interest; c
and r
•rSpecify security and privacy policies as part of the tailoring process for controls that have
variable parameters. :
In the few cases where specific technologies are referenced in controls, organizations are :
ocautioned that the need to manage security and privacy risks may go beyond the requirements
in a single control associated with a technology. The additional needed protection measures are r
, obtained from the other controls in the catalog. Federal Information Processing Standards
Special Publications, and Interagency/Internal Reports provide guidance on selecting security 0
8and privacy controls that reduce risk for specific technologies and sector-specific applications,
Iincluding smart grid, cloud, healthcare, mobile, industrial control systems, and Internet of Things S
33. NIST publications are cited as references as applicable to specific controls in (IoT) devices.S
Sections 3.1 through 3.20. .
Security and privacy controls in the catalog are expected to change over time as controls are 3
withdrawn, revised, and added. To maintain stability in security and privacy plans, controls are
not renumbered each time a control is withdrawn. Rather, notations of the controls that have
been withdrawn are maintained in the control catalog for historical purposes. Controls may be
withdrawn for a variety of reasons, including when the function or capability provided by the
control has been incorporated into another control, the control is redundant to an existing
control, or the control is deemed to be no longer necessary or effective.
32 The controls in this publication are available online and can be obtained in various formats. See [NVD 800-53].
33 For example, [SP 800-82] provides guidance on risk management and control selection for industrial control
systems.

New controls are developed on a regular basis using threat and vulnerability information and
information on the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by adversaries. In addition, new
controls are developed based on a better understanding of how to mitigate information security
risks to systems and organizations and risks to the privacy of individuals arising from information
processing. Finally, new controls are developed based on new or changing requirements in laws,
executive orders, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines. Proposed modifications to the
controls are carefully analyzed during each revision cycle, considering the need for stability of
controls and the need to be responsive to changing technologies, threats, vulnerabilities, types
of attack, and processing methods. The objective is to adjust the level of information security
and privacy over time to meet the needs of organizations and individuals.
