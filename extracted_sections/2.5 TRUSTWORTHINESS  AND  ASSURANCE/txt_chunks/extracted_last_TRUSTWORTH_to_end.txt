The trustworthiness of systems, system components, and system services is an important part a

context, means worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever requirements may be needed for a
component, subsystem, system, network, application, mission, business function, enterprise, or e
31f Trustworthiness requirements can include attributes of reliability, dependability, other entity.
performance, resilience, safety, security, privacy, and survivability under a range of potential a
eadversity in the form of disruptions, hazards, threats, and privacy risks. Effective measures of
otrustworthiness are meaningful only to the extent that the requirements are complete, well-
:defined, and can be accurately assessed.
:functionalityTwo fundamental concepts that affect the trustworthiness of systems are  and /
assurance. Functionality is defined in terms of the security and privacy features, functions, i.
mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented within organizational g
0systems and programs and the environments in which those systems and programs operate.
0Assurance is the measure of confidence that the system functionality is implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security /
Sand privacy requirements for the system—thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate
Sand enforce established security and privacy policies.
0In general, the task of providing meaningful assurance that a system is likely to do what is
expected of it can be enhanced by techniques that simplify or narrow the analysis by, for
example, increasing the discipline applied to the system architecture, software design,
specifications, code style, and configuration management. Security and privacy controls address
functionality and assurance. Certain controls focus primarily on functionality while other
controls focus primarily on assurance. Some controls can support functionality and assurance.

30[ SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on systems security engineering and the application of security design principles
to achieve trustworthy systems.

Organizations can select assurance-related controls to define system development activities,
generate evidence about the functionality and behavior of the system, and trace the evidence to
the system elements that provide such functionality or exhibit such behavior. The evidence is
used to obtain a degree of confidence that the system satisfies the stated security and privacy
requirements while supporting the organization’s mission and business functions. Assurance-
. related controls are identified in the control summary tables in Appendix C
EVIDENCE OF CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION
During control selection and implementation, it is important for organizations to consider the
Tevidence (e.g., artifacts, documentation) that will be needed to support current and future
iscontrol assessments. Such assessments help determine whether the controls are implemented
ucorrectly, operating as intended, and satisfying security and privacy policies—thus, providing
lirisk-basedessential information for senior leaders to make informed  decisions. c
