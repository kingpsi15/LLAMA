Effective measures of\notrustworthiness are meaningful only to the extent that the requirements are complete, well-\n:defined, and can be accurately assessed.\n:functionalityTwo fundamental concepts that affect the trustworthiness of systems are  and /\nassurance. Functionality is defined in terms of the security and privacy features, functions, i.\nmechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented within organizational g\n0systems and programs and the environments in which those systems and programs operate.\n0Assurance is the measure of confidence that the system functionality is implemented correctly,\noperating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security /\nSand privacy requirements for the system\u2014thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate\nSand enforce established security and privacy policies.\n0In general, the task of providing meaningful assurance that a system is likely to do what is\nexpected of it can be enhanced by techniques that simplify or narrow the analysis by, for\nexample, increasing the discipline applied to the system architecture, software design,\nspecifications, code style, and configuration management. Security and privacy controls address\nfunctionality and assurance. Certain controls focus primarily on functionality while other\ncontrols focus primarily on assurance. Some controls can support functionality and assurance.\n29 Resources to support information security and privacy program collaboration are available at [SP 800-53 RES].\n30[ SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on systems security engineering and the application of security design principles\nto achieve trustworthy systems.\n31 See [NEUM04].\nCHAPTER TWO  PAGE 14\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOrganizations can select assurance-related controls to define system development activities,\ngenerate evidence about the functionality and behavior of the system, and trace the evidence to\nthe system elements that provide such functionality or exhibit such behavior. The evidence is\nused to obtain a degree of confidence that the system satisfies the stated security and privacy\nrequirements while supporting the organization\u2019s mission and business functions. Assurance-\n. related controls are identified in the control summary tables in Appendix C\nEVIDENCE OF CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION\nDuring control selection and implementation, it is important for organizations to consider the\nTevidence (e.g., artifacts, documentation) that will be needed to support current and future\niscontrol assessments. Such assessments help determine whether the controls are implemented\nucorrectly, operating as intended, and satisfying security and privacy policies\u2014thus, providing\nlirisk-basedessential information for senior leaders to make informed  decisions. c\nCHAPTER TWO  PAGE 15"
