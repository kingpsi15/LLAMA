Discussion:  Organizations determine the content of training based on the assigned roles and :
responsibilities of individuals as well as the security and privacy requirements of organizations
oand the systems to which personnel have authorized access, including technical training
specifically tailored for assigned duties. Roles that may require role-based training include senior /
leaders or management officials (e.g., head of agency/chief executive officer, chief information .
officer, senior accountable official for risk management, senior agency information security 2

Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and
responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical controls. Role-based training also
includes policies, procedures, tools, methods, and artifacts for the security and privacy roles
defined. Organizations provide the training necessary for individuals to fulfill their responsibilities
related to operations and supply chain risk management within the context of organizational
security and privacy programs. Role-based training also applies to contractors who provide

Events that may precipitate an update to role-based training content include, but are not limited
to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,
