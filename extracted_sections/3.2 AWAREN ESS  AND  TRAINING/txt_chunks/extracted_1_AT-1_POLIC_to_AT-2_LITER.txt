tDiscussion:  Awareness and training policy and procedures address the controls in the AT family p
:that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an /
oimportant factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute
to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs r
1collaborate on the development of awareness and training policy and procedures. Security and
6privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and
may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be
included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies
that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and T
privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
8describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and -
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to r
awareness and training policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security
incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an
organizational policy or procedure.
