AT-2 LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS

executives, and contractors):

ld.Incorporate lessons learned from internal or external security incidents or breaches into i c
tliteracy training and awareness techniques. i
iDiscussion:  Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of literacy training to system users, s
including measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of v
lliteracy training and awareness based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to a
lwhich personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content e
rincludes an understanding of the need for security and privacy as well as actions by users to e
maintain security and personal privacy and to respond to suspected incidents. The content
caddresses the need for operations security and the handling of personally identifiable
information.
fAwareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security and
privacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from
horganizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Literacy training after the initial
is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable training described in AT-2a.1s
/laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Subsequent literacy training may be satisfied by one or d
imore short ad hoc sessions and include topical information on recent attack schemes, changes to .
gorganizational security and privacy policies, revised security and privacy expectations, or a subset
0of topics from the initial training. Updating literacy training and awareness content on a regular
0basis helps to ensure that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to
literacy training and awareness content include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit
Ifindings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, S
directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. .

| (1) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  PRACTICAL EXERCISES
Provide practical exercises in literacy training that simulate events and incidents.
Discussion:  Practical exercises include no-notice social engineering attempts to collect
information, gain unauthorized access, or simulate the adverse impact of opening malicious
email attachments or invoking, via spear phishing attacks, malicious web links.

| (2) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  INSIDER THREAT
Provide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

Discussion:  Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat can include
behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to
information not required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources;
bullying or harassment of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations
of policies, procedures, directives, regulations, rules, or practices. Literacy training includes
how to communicate the concerns of employees and management regarding potential
indicators of insider threat through channels established by the organization and in
accordance with established policies and procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring
insider threat awareness topics to the role. For example, training for managers may be
focused on changes in the behavior of team members, while training for employees may be
focused on more general observations.

| (3) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND MININGh
Provide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual instances of p
b social engineering and social mining.
Discussion:  Social engineering is an attempt to trick an individual into revealing information t
nor taking an action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a
system. Social engineering includes phishing, pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro
quo, thread-jacking, social media exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to a
gather information about the organization that may be used to support future attacks.
Literacy training includes information on how to communicate the concerns of employees
eand management regarding potential and actual instances of social engineering and data
omining through organizational channels based on established policies and procedures.

Sthat appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how
.to respond to suspicious email or web communications. For this process to work effectively, S
personnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. .
Training personnel on how to recognize anomalous behaviors in systems can provide 0
organizations with early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of 3
anomalous behavior by organizational personnel can supplement malicious code detection
and protection tools and systems employed by organizations.
Related Controls:  None.
| (5) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT
Provide literacy training on the advanced persistent threat.
Discussion:  An effective way to detect advanced persistent threats (APT) and to preclude
successful attacks is to provide specific literacy training for individuals. Threat literacy
training includes educating individuals on the various ways that APTs can infiltrate the
organization (e.g., through websites, emails, advertisement pop-ups, articles, and social

organization is dynamic. Moreover, threat literacy training is not performed in isolation from
the system operations that support organizational mission and business functions.
