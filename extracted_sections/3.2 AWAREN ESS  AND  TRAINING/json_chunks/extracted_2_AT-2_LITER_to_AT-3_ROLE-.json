Organizations determine the content of v\nlliteracy training and awareness based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to a\nlwhich personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content e\nrincludes an understanding of the need for security and privacy as well as actions by users to e\nmaintain security and personal privacy and to respond to suspected incidents. The content\ncaddresses the need for operations security and the handling of personally identifiable\ninformation.\nfAwareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security and\nprivacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from\nhorganizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Literacy training after the initial\nis conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable training described in AT-2a.1s\n/laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Subsequent literacy training may be satisfied by one or d\nimore short ad hoc sessions and include topical information on recent attack schemes, changes to .\ngorganizational security and privacy policies, revised security and privacy expectations, or a subset\n0of topics from the initial training. Updating literacy training and awareness content on a regular\n0basis helps to ensure that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to\nliteracy training and awareness content include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit\nIfindings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, S\ndirectives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. .\n8Related Controls:  AC-3, AC-17, AC-22, AT-3, AT-4, CP-3, IA-4, IR-2, IR-7, IR-9, PL-4, PM-13, PM-21,\nPS-7, PT-2, SA-8, SA-16.\nControl Enhancements: 5\n| (1) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  PRACTICAL EXERCISES\nProvide practical exercises in literacy training that simulate events and incidents.\nDiscussion:  Practical exercises include no-notice social engineering attempts to collect\ninformation, gain unauthorized access, or simulate the adverse impact of opening malicious\nemail attachments or invoking, via spear phishing attacks, malicious web links.\nRelated Controls:  CA-2, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3.\n| (2) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  INSIDER THREAT\nProvide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 60\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat can include\nbehaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to\ninformation not required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources;\nbullying or harassment of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations\nof policies, procedures, directives, regulations, rules, or practices. Literacy training includes\nhow to communicate the concerns of employees and management regarding potential\nindicators of insider threat through channels established by the organization and in\naccordance with established policies and procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring\ninsider threat awareness topics to the role. For example, training for managers may be\nfocused on changes in the behavior of team members, while training for employees may be\nfocused on more general observations.\nRelated Controls:  PM-12.\n| (3) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND MININGh\nProvide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual instances of p\nb social engineering and social mining.\nDiscussion:  Social engineering is an attempt to trick an individual into revealing information t\nnor taking an action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a\nsystem. Social engineering includes phishing, pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro\nquo, thread-jacking, social media exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to a\ngather information about the organization that may be used to support future attacks.\nLiteracy training includes information on how to communicate the concerns of employees\neand management regarding potential and actual instances of social engineering and data\nomining through organizational channels based on established policies and procedures.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|(4) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  SUSPICIOUS COMMUNICATIONS AND ANOMALOUS SYSTEM\nBEHAVIORm\nhProvide literacy training on recognizing suspicious communications and anomalous\nAssignment: organization-defined indicators of behavior in organizational systems using [s\n/malicious code]. d\nDiscussion:  A well-trained workforce provides another organizational control that can be o\nemployed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect against malicious code coming /\ninto organizations via email or the web applications. Personnel are trained to look for .\nindications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected email, receiving an 2\n/email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an unfamiliar sender N\nSthat appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how\n.to respond to suspicious email or web communications. For this process to work effectively, S\npersonnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. .\nTraining personnel on how to recognize anomalous behaviors in systems can provide 0\norganizations with early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of 3\nanomalous behavior by organizational personnel can supplement malicious code detection\nand protection tools and systems employed by organizations.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (5) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT\nProvide literacy training on the advanced persistent threat.\nDiscussion:  An effective way to detect advanced persistent threats (APT) and to preclude\nsuccessful attacks is to provide specific literacy training for individuals. Threat literacy\ntraining includes educating individuals on the various ways that APTs can infiltrate the\norganization (e.g., through websites, emails, advertisement pop-ups, articles, and social\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 61\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nengineering). Effective training includes techniques for recognizing suspicious emails, use of\nremovable systems in non-secure settings, and the potential targeting of individuals at\nhome.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (6) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS  CYBER THREAT ENVIRONMENT\n(a)Provide literacy training on the cyber threat environment; and\ncurrent cyber threat information in system operations. (b)Reflect\nDiscussion:  Since threats continue to change over time, threat literacy training by the\norganization is dynamic. Moreover, threat literacy training is not performed in isolation from\nthe system operations that support organizational mission and business functions.\nRelated Controls:  RA-3.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-50], [SP 800-160-2], [SP 800-181], [ODNI CTF]. is"
