Discussion:  Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management (OPM) policy and
guidance. Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability
and personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and
responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or
integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk
level of that position. The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of T
ithe position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse s
effect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the u
lisensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation c
tis conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations i
that individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems.
Position screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements. a
aParts 1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, establish the requirements for
borganizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk
designation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions.
