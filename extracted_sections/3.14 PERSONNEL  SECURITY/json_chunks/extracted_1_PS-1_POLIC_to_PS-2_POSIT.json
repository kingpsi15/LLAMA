The risk management strategy is an important d\nifactor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security .\ngand privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate\n0on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization\nlevel are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific 0\n8policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy\nIpolicy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations.\nProcedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, .\nand for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented\n0and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can\nbe documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. 5\nEvents that may precipitate an update to personnel security policy and procedures include, but 5\nare not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in\napplicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\nSimply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100].\nCHAPTER THREE    PAGE 222\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
