Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability\nand personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and\nresponsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or\nintegrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk\nlevel of that position. The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of T\nithe position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse s\neffect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the u\nlisensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation c\ntis conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations i\nthat individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems.\nPosition screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements. a\naParts 1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, establish the requirements for\nborganizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk\ndesignation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions.\nRelated Controls:  AC-5, AT-3, PE-2, PE-3, PL-2, PS-3, PS-6, SA-5, SA-21, SI-12. o\nhControl Enhancements:  None.\neReferences:  [5 CFR 731], [SP 800-181]."
