Discussion:  External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems,
and for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required c
controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned
esystems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in
ocommercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;
:systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by,
toperated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems
:also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and
osystems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the
option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of
external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned 1
.or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems). 6
For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships
Ithat have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be S
such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may .
not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing
0information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations
5or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders,
directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational 5
personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and
over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding
system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be
uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.
Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors
than on state, local, or tribal governments.
External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope
. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in of AC-20
accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and
conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational

Control Enhancements:
| (1) USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS  LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE
Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process,
store, or transmit organization-controlled information only after:
(a)Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in
the organization’s security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans; or
(b)Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the  is
organizational entity hosting the external system.
liDiscussion:  Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using c
texternal systems may need to access organizational systems. Organizations need assurance i
that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage,
or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been a
aimplemented can be achieved by external, independent assessments, attestations, or other
bmeans, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.

Discussion:  Non-organizationally owned systems or system components include systems or

There are potential risks to using non-organizationally owned systems or components. In P

the use of such systems or system components may be allowed but restricted in some way. -
Restrictions include requiring the implementation of approved controls prior to authorizing r
the connection of non-organizationally owned systems and components; limiting access to
types of information, services, or applications; using virtualization techniques to limit
processing and storage activities to servers or system components provisioned by the
organization; and agreeing to the terms and conditions for usage. Organizations consult with
the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using personally
owned devices, including requirements for conducting forensic analyses during
investigations after an incident.

Prohibit the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized
