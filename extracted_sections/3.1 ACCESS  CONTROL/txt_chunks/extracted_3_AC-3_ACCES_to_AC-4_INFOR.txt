isAC-3 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT
Control:  Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources
bin accordance with applicable access control policies.
Discussion:  Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users e
or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, o
cdomains) in organizational systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level
and recognizing that systems can host many applications and services in support of mission and r
business functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and
service level to provide increased information security and privacy. In contrast to logical access  m

Discussion:  Dual authorization, also known as two-person control, reduces risk related to
insider threats. Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized
individuals to execute. To reduce the risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating dual
authorization duties. Organizations consider the risk associated with implementing dual
authorization mechanisms when immediate responses are necessary to ensure public and
environmental safety.

Discussion:Mandatory access control is a type of nondiscretionary access control.   n
isMandatory access control policies constrain what actions subjects can take with information
obtained from objects for which they have already been granted access. This prevents the
lasubjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. Mandatory
leaccess control policies constrain actions that subjects can take with respect to the
epropagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that
oprivilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to
which the system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented. This
enforcement is provided by an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept as r
AC-25. The policy is bounded by the system (i.e., once the information is passed described in
outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure that the  m
constraints on the information remain in effect). h

to another subject operating at a different impact or classification level, AC-3(4) permits the
subject to pass the information to any other subject with the same impact or classification
level as the subject. Examples of mandatory access control policies include the Bell-LaPadula
policy to protect confidentiality of information and the Biba policy to protect the integrity of
information.

(c)Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the system, or the systemâ€™s

(d)Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects;
(e)Change the rules governing access control.
Discussion:When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not
constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have
already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information
are not prevented from passing the information to other subjects or objects (i.e., subjects
have the discretion to pass). Discretionary access control can operate in conjunction with
mandatory access control as described in AC-3(3) and AC-3(15). A subject that is constrained
in its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under the less rigorous h

Discussion:  Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that enforces access
to objects and system functions based on the defined role (i.e., job function) of the subject.
Organizations can create specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e.,
privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-
defined roles. When users are assigned to specific roles, they inherit the authorizations or
privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations
because privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a large number of
individuals) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can also increase

Discussion:  Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access revoked. For
example, if a subject (i.e., user or process acting on behalf of a user) is removed from a
group, access may not be revoked until the next time the object is opened or the next time is
the subject attempts to access the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels
may take effect immediately. Organizations provide alternative approaches on how to make lic
revocations immediate if systems cannot provide such capability and immediate revocation t

fAssignment: organization-defined controlsprovides []; and
aAssignment: organization-defined controls(b)[] are used to validate the appropriateness

Discussion:  Organizations can only directly protect information when it resides within the  m
system. Additional controls may be needed to ensure that organizational information is
tadequately protected once it is transmitted outside of the system. In situations where the p
system is unable to determine the adequacy of the protections provided by external entities, /
oas a mitigation measure, organizations procedurally determine whether the external systems
are providing adequate controls. The means used to determine the adequacy of controls r
1provided by external systems include conducting periodic assessments (inspections/tests),
6establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations, or
some other process. The means used by external entities to protect the information received 8
need not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are
Tsufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security and privacy policy to protect the
information and individualsâ€™ privacy. P
Controlled release of information requires systems to implement technical or procedural
means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For example, if
5the system passes information to a system controlled by another organization, technical
means are employed to validate that the security and privacy attributes associated with the
exported information are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the system
passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be
employed to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to the printer.

Discussion:  Attribute-based access control is an access control policy that restricts system
Iaccess to authorized users based on specified organizational attributes (e.g., job function,
identity), action attributes (e.g., read, write, delete), environmental attributes (e.g., time of .
day, location), and resource attributes (e.g., classification of a document). Organizations can
0create rules based on attributes and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed
5operations on the systems associated with organization-defined attributes and rules. When
users are assigned to attributes defined in attribute-based access control policies or rules, 5
they can be provisioned to a system with the appropriate privileges or dynamically granted
access to a protected resource. Attribute-based access control can be implemented as either
