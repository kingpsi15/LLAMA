vAC-17 REMOTE ACCESS
bControl:
a.Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and  e
implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and o
b.Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections.
Discussion:  Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of
users) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access  m
:include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks
t(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted p
:VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such /
oconnections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in
accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, r
1and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does
6not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect
the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote
access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public

|  (1) REMOTE ACCESS  MONITORING AND CONTROL
Employ automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods.
Discussion:Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to
detect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the
connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components, including servers,

|  (2) REMOTE ACCESS  PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY USING ENCRYPTION
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of
remote access sessions.
Discussion:Virtual private networks can be used to protect the confidentiality and integrity
of remote access sessions. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an example of a cryptographic
protocol that provides end-to-end communications security over networks and is used for
Internet communications and online transactions.

liDHS Discussion:  Organizations consider the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative [c
TIC] requirements for external network connections since limiting the number of access i
control points for remote access reduces attack surfaces.

(b)Document the rationale for remote access in the security plan for the system.
Discussion:  Remote access to systems represents a significant potential vulnerability that
can be exploited by adversaries. As such, restricting the execution of privileged commands  m
and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the h
porganization and the susceptibility to threats by adversaries to the remote access capability.

Discussion:The speed of system disconnect or disablement varies based on the criticality of
missions or business functions and the need to eliminate immediate or future remote access
to systems.

Assignment: organization-defined mechanismsAssignment: Implement [] to authenticate [
organization-defined remote commands].
Discussion:Authenticating remote commands protects against unauthorized commands and
the replay of authorized commands. The ability to authenticate remote commands is
Timportant for remote systems for which loss, malfunction, misdirection, or exploitation
iwould have immediate or serious consequences, such as injury, death, property damage, s
uloss of high value assets, failure of mission or business functions, or compromise of classified
lior controlled unclassified information. Authentication mechanisms for remote commands c
tensure that systems accept and execute commands in the order intended, execute only i
authorized commands, and reject unauthorized commands. Cryptographic mechanisms can
be used, for example, to authenticate remote commands. a
