iAC-6 LEAST PRIVILEGE .
1Control:  Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or
6processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational
tasks.
IDiscussion:  Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and systems. The principle of S
least privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring that the processes have access to .
systems and operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish organizational
missions or business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles,
5and accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations apply least privilege to the
5development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems.

Discussion:Security functions include establishing system accounts, configuring access
authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configuring settings for events to be audited,
and establishing intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes
filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services,
cryptographic key management information, and access control lists. Authorized personnel
include security administrators, system administrators, system security officers, system
programmers, and other privileged users.

Assignment: organization-Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [
defined security functions or security-relevant information] use non-privileged accounts or
roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.
Discussion:Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity   is
functions limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The
inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control lic
policies, such as role-based access control, and where a change of role provides the same t
ndegree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and the processes
acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-
privileged account. a

.privileges includes using virtualization techniques to permit additional user privileges within 6
2a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to the underlying
Nphysical machine, implementing separate physical domains, and employing hardware or
software domain separation mechanisms. T

Assignment: organization-defined personnel Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [
or roles].
Discussion:Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as
system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems.
Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from
accessing privileged information or privileged functions. Organizations may differentiate in
the application of restricting privileged accounts between allowed privileges for local
accounts and for domain accounts provided that they retain the ability to control system
configurations for key parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.

|-  (6) LEAST PRIVILEGE  PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NONORGANIZATIONAL USERS
Prohibit privileged access to the system by non-organizational users.
Discussion:  An organizational user is an employee or an individual considered by the
organization to have the equivalent status of an employee. Organizational users include
contractors, guest researchers, or individuals detailed from other organizations. A non-
organizational user is a user who is not an organizational user. Policies and procedures for
granting equivalent status of employees to individuals include a need-to-know, citizenship,
and the relationship to the organization.

TAssignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users[] to validate the need for
issuch privileges; and
(b)Reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission b
and business needs. a
Discussion:  The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time to reflect n
ischanges in organizational mission and business functions, environments of operation,
vtechnologies, or threats. A periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to
ladetermine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be
lerevalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.

rPreventthe following software from executing at higher privilege levels than users
Assignment: organization-defined software executing the software: [].
mDiscussion:  In certain situations, software applications or programs need to execute with
helevated privileges to perform required functions. However, depending on the software
functionality and configuration, if the privileges required for execution are at a higher level s
/than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking such applications or programs, d
ithose users may indirectly be provided with greater privileges than assigned. .

Discussion:The misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
Sauthorized users or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system
.accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on
0organizations. Logging and analyzing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect
such misuse and, in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced 3
persistent threat.

Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.
Discussion:Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented
security or privacy controls, establishing system accounts, performing system integrity
checks, and administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users
are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Privileged functions that
require protection from non-privileged users include circumventing intrusion detection and
