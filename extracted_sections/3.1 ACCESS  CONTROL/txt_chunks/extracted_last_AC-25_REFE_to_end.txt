AC-25 REFERENCE MONITOR
Assignment: organization-defined access control Control:  Implement a reference monitor for [
policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be subject to analysis and
testing, the completeness of which can be assured.
Discussion:  A reference monitor is a set of design requirements on a reference validation
mechanism that, as a key component of an operating system, enforces an access control policy
licover all subjects and objects. A reference validation mechanism is always invoked, tamper-proof,
iand small enough to be subject to analysis and tests, the completeness of which can be assured o
(i.e., verifiable). Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as is
data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and
passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with individuals, devices, or i
processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are associated le
fwith data structures, such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables, files, and inter-r
process pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies that restrict access to objects
based on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The system enforces
the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamper-proof a
property of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from compromising the e
rfunctioning of the reference validation mechanism. The always invoked property prevents o
adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and violating the security policy. The smallness :
tproperty helps to ensure completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect
any weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the
security policy.
