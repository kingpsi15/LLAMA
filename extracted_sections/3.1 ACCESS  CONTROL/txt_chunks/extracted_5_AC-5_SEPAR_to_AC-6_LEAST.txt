AC-5 SEPARATION OF DUTIES
Control:
Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals requiring a.Identify and document [
hseparation]; and
b.Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.  u
Discussion:  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and a
helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes
idividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, s
conducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security v
lpersonnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. a
lBecause separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations e
rconsider the entirety of systems and system components when developing policy on separation e
AC-2, of duties. Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in
caccess control mechanisms in AC-3, and identity management activities in IA-2, IA-4, and IA-12.
