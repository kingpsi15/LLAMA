Discussion:  Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest,
anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized system
users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the
security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional
scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged
access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security
officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to
prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and
guest accounts.

Where access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with
the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role
membership; specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for
each account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational
policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that
trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other
attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes
required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of
origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related
requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect
system availability.
Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish
temporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for T
ishort-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations s
establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account u
lactivation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization ic
tprocesses. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used
accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are
unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and a
aare not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating
accounts include when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required b
and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group authenticators when
members leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access e
to the shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training. f

capabilities].
Discussion:  In contrast to access control approaches that employ static accounts and t
predefined user privileges, dynamic access control approaches rely on runtime access :
control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management, such as attribute-based o
access control. While user identities remain relatively constant over time, user privileges
/typically change more frequently based on ongoing mission or business requirements and 1
.the operational needs of organizations. An example of dynamic privilege management is the 6
2immediate revocation of privileges from users as opposed to requiring that users terminate
Nand restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can
also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to
editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if
they are operating out of their normal work times, if their job function or assignment 8
changes, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations. Dynamic privilege
3management includes the effects of privilege changes, for example, when there are changes
to encryption keys used for communications.

Discussion:  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow
those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not
authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key management, account management,
database administration, system and network administration, and web administration. A
role-based access scheme organizes permitted system access and privileges into roles. In
contrast, an attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges
based on attributes.
Related Controls:  None.

Assignment: organization-defined system Create, activate, manage, and deactivate [
accounts] dynamically.
Discussion:  Approaches for dynamically creating, activating, managing, and deactivating
system accounts rely on automatically provisioning the accounts at runtime for entities that is
were previously unknown. Organizations plan for the dynamic management, creation,
activation, and deactivation of system accounts by establishing trust relationships, business lic
rules, and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate related authorizations and t
nprivileges.
