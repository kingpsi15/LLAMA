hAC-11 DEVICE LOCK
Control: :
Selection (one or more): initiating a device lock after ia.Prevent further access to the system by [ .
Assignment: organization-defined time period of inactivity;requiring the user to initiate a [] g
device lock before leaving the system unattended]; and 0
2b.Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and
Nauthentication procedures.
Discussion:  Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent logical access to organizational
Psystems when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of those systems but
0do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. Device locks can be
implemented at the operating system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be 5
rused to initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle). User-initiated 5
device locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such, requires users to take physical action to
initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems,
such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.
