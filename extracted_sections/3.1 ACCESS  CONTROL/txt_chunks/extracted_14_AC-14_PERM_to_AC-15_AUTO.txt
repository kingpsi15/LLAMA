AC-14 PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION
Control:
Assignment: organization-defined user actionsa.Identify [] that can be performed on the
system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational mission and
business functions; and
b.Document and provide supporting rationale in the security plan for the system, user actions
not requiring identification or authentication.
TDiscussion:  Specific user actions may be permitted without identification or authentication if
isorganizations determine that identification and authentication are not required for the specified
uuser actions. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or
liauthentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible c
tfederal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are i
received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but
amay, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be
bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that
bcommands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored
use. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations f
ewhere identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather
fto situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may
decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without
identification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be
f“none.” r
