Discussion:  Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as
data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and
subjectspassive. Active entities, also known as , are typically associated with individuals, devices,
objectsor processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as , are typically
associated with data structures, such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and
communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions that represent T
ithe basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding s
information. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently or in conjunction with security u
lattributes, represent the basic properties or characteristics of active or passive entities with ic
respect to the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes can be either t
explicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems or
system components. a
iAttributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or la
lreceive information, cause information to flow among objects, or change the system state. These e
rattributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive
information. The association of attributes to subjects and objects by a system is referred to as
binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Attributes, when c
abound to data or information, permit the enforcement of security and privacy policies for access
econtrol and information flow control, including data retention limits, permitted uses of
opersonally identifiable information, and identification of personal information within data
:objects. Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions or
mechanisms. The binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength of attribute t
binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques :
play important parts in the trust that organizations have in the information flow enforcement o
process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by
/organizations. The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of 1
.individuals to access organizational information. 6
8Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for systems to support missions or
Ibusiness functions. There are many values that can be assigned to a security attribute. By
specifying the permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations ensure that attribute values .
are meaningful and relevant. Labeling refers to the association of attributes with the subjects
0and objects represented by the internal data structures within systems. This facilitates system-
based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Labels include classification of 5
information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements (e.g., top secret, secret, 5
confidential, controlled unclassified), information impact level; high value asset information,
access authorizations, nationality; data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),
personally identifiable information processing permissions, including individual consent to
personally identifiable information processing, and contractor affiliation. A related term to
labeling is marking. Marking refers to the association of attributes with objects in a human-
readable form and displayed on system media. Marking enables manual, procedural, or process-
based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Security and privacy labels may
(Media have the same value as media markings (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential). See MP-3
Marking).

Assignment: organization-Dynamically associate security and privacy attributes with [
defined subjects and objectsecurity and privacy policies s] in accordance with the following
Assignment: organization-defined security and as information is created and combined: [
privacy policies].
Discussion:Dynamic association of attributes is appropriate whenever the security or
privacy characteristics of information change over time. Attributes may change due to
information aggregation issues (i.e., characteristics of individual data elements are different
Tfrom the combined elements), changes in individual access authorizations (i.e., privileges),
ichanges in the security category of information, or changes in security or privacy policies. s
uAttributes may also change situationally.

aProvide authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) the capability
to define or change the value of associated security and privacy attributes. i
Discussion:The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of   le
individuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for systems to be r
able to limit the ability to create or modify attributes to authorized individuals.

pDiscussion:Maintaining the association and integrity of security and privacy attributes to
/subjects and objects with sufficient assurance helps to ensure that the attribute associations /
can be used as the basis of automated policy actions. The integrity of specific items, such as
rsecurity configuration files, may be maintained through the use of an integrity monitoring
mechanism that detects anomalies and changes that deviate from “known good” baselines.
Automated policy actions include retention date expirations, access control decisions,
information flow control decisions, and information disclosure decisions. 8

Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy Provide the capability to associate [0
-attributesAssignment: organization-defined subjects and objects] with [] by authorized 5
rindividuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals).
Discussion:Systems, in general, provide the capability for privileged users to assign security
and privacy attributes to system-defined subjects (e.g., users) and objects (e.g., directories,
files, and ports). Some systems provide additional capability for general users to assign
security and privacy attributes to additional objects (e.g., files, emails). The association of
attributes by authorized individuals is described in the design documentation. The support
provided by systems can include prompting users to select security and privacy attributes to
be associated with information objects, employing automated mechanisms to categorize
information with attributes based on defined policies, or ensuring that the combination of
the security or privacy attributes selected is valid. Organizations consider the creation,
deletion, or modification of attributes when defining auditable events.

rDiscussion:To enforce security and privacy policies across multiple system components in
distributed systems, organizations provide a consistent interpretation of security and privacy
attributes employed in access enforcement and flow enforcement decisions. Organizations t
scan establish agreements and processes to help ensure that distributed system components

security and privacy attributes to information.
Discussion:The association of security and privacy attributes to information within systems
8is important for conducting automated access enforcement and flow enforcement actions.
The association of such attributes to information (i.e., binding) can be accomplished with -
technologies and techniques that provide different levels of assurance. For example, systems
can cryptographically bind attributes to information using digital signatures that support
cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices (sometimes known as hardware roots of
trust).

used by organizations to provide the requisite levels of assurance for attribute reassignment
activities. The validation is facilitated by ensuring that regrading mechanisms are single
purpose and of limited function. Since security and privacy attribute changes can directly
affect policy enforcement actions, implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms is
necessary to help ensure that such mechanisms perform in a consistent and correct mode of
operation.

Provide authorized individuals the capability to define or change the type and value of
security and privacy attributes available for association with subjects and objects.
Discussion:The content or assigned values of security and privacy attributes can directly
affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Thus, it is important for
systems to be able to limit the ability to create or modify the type and value of attributes is
available for association with subjects and objects to authorized individuals only.
