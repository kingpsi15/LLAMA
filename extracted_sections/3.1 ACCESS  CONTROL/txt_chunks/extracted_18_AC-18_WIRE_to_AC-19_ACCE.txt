oAC-18 WIRELESS ACCESS
aControl:
a.Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation  f
mguidance for each type of wireless access; and
tb.Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections.  t
Discussion:  Wireless technologies include microwave, packet radio (ultra-high frequency or very /
high frequency), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that i.
provide authenticator protection and mutual authentication. g
Related Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-9, CM-7, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, PL-4, SC-40, SC-43, SI-4. .
8Control Enhancements:
| (1) WIRELESS ACCESS  AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION
Selection (one or more): Protect wireless access to the system using authentication of [P
users; devices] and encryption.
Discussion:  Wireless networking capabilities represent a significant potential vulnerability 5
rthat can be exploited by adversaries. To protect systems with wireless access points, strong 5
authentication of users and devices along with strong encryption can reduce susceptibility to
threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.
Related Controls:  SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.
| (2) WIRELESS ACCESS  MONITORING UNAUTHORIZED CONNECTIONS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4.]
| (3) WIRELESS ACCESS  DISABLE WIRELESS NETWORKING
Disable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities embedded within
system components prior to issuance and deployment.

Discussion:  Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system components
represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Disabling
wireless capabilities when not needed for essential organizational missions or functions can
reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.
Related Controls:  None.
| (4) WIRELESS ACCESS  RESTRICT CONFIGURATIONS BY USERS
Identify and explicitly authorize users allowed to independently configure wireless
networking capabilities.
Discussion:  Organizational authorizations to allow selected users to configure wireless
networking capabilities are enforced, in part, by the access enforcement mechanisms
employed within organizational systems.
TRelated Controls:  SC-7, SC-15.
| p(5) WIRELESS ACCESS  ANTENNAS AND TRANSMISSION POWER LEVELS
lSelect radio antennas and calibrate transmission power levels to reduce the probability ic
that signals from wireless access points can be received outside of organization-controlled t
boundaries.
aDiscussion:  Actions that may be taken to limit unauthorized use of wireless communications
outside of organization-controlled boundaries include reducing the power of wireless i
btransmissions so that the transmissions are less likely to emit a signal that can be captured
outside of the physical perimeters of the organization, employing measures such as f
eemissions security to control wireless emanations, and using directional or beamforming
fantennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended receivers will be able to intercept
signals. Prior to taking such mitigating actions, organizations can conduct periodic wireless a
surveys to understand the radio frequency profile of organizational systems as well as other
systems that may be operating in the area. r
