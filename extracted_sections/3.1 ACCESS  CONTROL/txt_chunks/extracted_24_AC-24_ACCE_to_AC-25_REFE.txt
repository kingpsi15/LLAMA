AC-24 ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS p
lSelection: Establish procedures; Implement mechanismsAssignment: Control:  [] to ensure [ic
torganization-defined access control decisions] are applied to each access request prior to access i
enforcement.
Discussion:  Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur when v
lauthorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement occurs a
lwhen systems enforce access control decisions. While it is common to have access control e
rdecisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not required, and it is e
not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed systems,
cdifferent entities may make access control decisions and enforce access.

1Discussion:  Authorization processes and access control decisions may occur in separate
6parts of systems or in separate systems. In such instances, authorization information is
transmitted securely (e.g., using cryptographic mechanisms) so that timely access control
decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the access control
decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization information T
supporting security and privacy attributes. This is because in distributed systems, there are
8various access control decisions that need to be made, and different entities make these
decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring those attributes to make the decisions. -
Protecting access authorization information ensures that such information cannot be
altered, spoofed, or compromised during transmission.

Assignment: organization-defined security or Enforce access control decisions based on [

of the user.
Discussion:  In certain situations, it is important that access control decisions can be made
without information regarding the identity of the users issuing the requests. These are
generally instances where preserving individual privacy is of paramount importance. In other

situations, user identification information is simply not needed for access control decisions,
and especially in the case of distributed systems, transmitting such information with the
needed degree of assurance may be very expensive or difficult to accomplish. MAC, RBAC,
ABAC, and label-based control policies, for example, might not include user identity as an
attribute.
