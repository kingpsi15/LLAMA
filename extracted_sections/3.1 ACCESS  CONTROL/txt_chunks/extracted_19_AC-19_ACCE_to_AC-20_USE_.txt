a.Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation  0
8guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to include when such devices are
Ioutside of controlled areas; and
Sb.Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.
0Discussion:  A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can
easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; 5
rpossesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power 5
source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board
sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing
local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are
typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability
of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems,
depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile
devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and
control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which
organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for
protecting information and systems.

Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities,
organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage
restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration
management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective
software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for
critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other
resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.
Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For
example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and
impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile
device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing
mobile device connections to a system. Adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the
. Many safeguards for mobile devices are reflected in other requirements specified in AC-19T
icontrols. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled. s
