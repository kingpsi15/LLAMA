AC-12 SESSION TERMINATION
Assignment: organization-defined Control:  Automatically terminate a user session after [
conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect].
Discussion:  Session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions (in
contrast to SC-10, which addresses the termination of network connections associated with
communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect)). A logical session (for local, network, and
remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an
licorganizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated without terminating network
isessions. Session termination ends all processes associated with a userâ€™s logical session except o
for those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after is
the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events that require automatic termination of the
session include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain i
types of incidents, or time-of-day restrictions on system use. le

TDiscussion:  Logout messages for web access can be displayed after authenticated sessions
have been terminated. However, for certain types of sessions, including file transfer protocol P
(FTP) sessions, systems typically send logout messages as final messages prior to terminating
sessions. -

Assignment:  Display an explicit message to users indicating that the session will endin [
organization-defined time until end of session].
Discussion:  To increase usability, notify users of pending session termination and prompt
users to continue the session. The pending session termination time period is based on the
AC-12 base control.  parameters defined in the
