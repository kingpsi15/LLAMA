Discussion:  Access control policy and procedures address the controls in the AC family that are s
/implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important d
ifactor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security .
gand privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
0on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program
policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the 0
8need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part
Iof the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the
complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy .
programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe
0how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is
the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans 5
or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control 5
policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or
changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.
