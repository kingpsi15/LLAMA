oAC-9 PREVIOUS LOGON NOTIFICATION
Control:  Notify the user, upon successful logon to the system, of the date and time of the last a
alogon.
lDiscussion:  Previous logon notification is applicable to system access via human user interfaces e
rand access to systems that occurs in other types of architectures. Information about the last e
successful logon allows the user to recognize if the date and time provided is not consistent with
cthe user’s last access.

Notify the user, upon successful logon, of the following additional information:
Assignment: organization-defined additional information[].
Discussion:Organizations can specify additional information to be provided to users upon
logon, including the location of the last logon. User location is defined as information that
can be determined by systems, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from which network
logons occurred, notifications of local logons, or device identifiers.
