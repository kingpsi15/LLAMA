NDiscussion:  Data mining is an analytical process that attempts to find correlations or patterns in
large data sets for the purpose of data or knowledge discovery. Data storage objects include T
database records and database fields. Sensitive information can be extracted from data mining
8operations. When information is personally identifiable information, it may lead to unanticipated
revelations about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing data mining -
activities, organizations determine whether such activities are authorized. Organizations may be
subject to applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that address data
mining requirements. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy
and legal counsel regarding such requirements.
Data mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number and frequency of
database queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of databases,
limiting types of responses provided to database queries, applying differential privacy techniques
or homomorphic encryption, and notifying personnel when atypical database queries or accesses
occur. Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from data mining while such
focuses on monitoring for information resides in organizational data stores. In contrast, AU-13

] requires the establishment of an insider threat program for deterring, detecting, and [EO 13587
mitigating insider threats, including the safeguarding of sensitive information from exploitation,
compromise, or other unauthorized disclosure. Data mining protection requires organizations to
identify appropriate techniques to prevent and detect unnecessary or unauthorized data mining.
Data mining can be used by an insider to collect organizational information for the purpose of
exfiltration.
