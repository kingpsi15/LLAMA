action]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded. lic
iDiscussion:  The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent action when the o
maximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a is
alocal or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts
initiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, i
organization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ
fdifferent algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those r
components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating
system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the
number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to a
answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode e
rwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified o
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying
tuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)
address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in
support of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to
ohelp prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to
respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is /
exceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not .
permitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need. 2

Discussion:  A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it
can be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection;
possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained
power source. Purging or wiping the device applies only to mobile devices for which the
organization-defined number of unsuccessful logons occurs. The logon is to the mobile

devices reset the unsuccessful logon count to zero. Purging or wiping may be unnecessary if
the information on the device is protected with sufficiently strong encryption mechanisms.

Assignment: organization-Limit the number of unsuccessful biometric logon attempts to [
defined number ].
Discussion:  Biometrics are probabilistic in nature. The ability to successfully authenticate
can be impacted by many factors, including matching performance and presentation attack
detection mechanisms. Organizations select the appropriate number of attempts for users
based on organizationally-defined factors.

Discussion:  The use of alternate authentication factors supports the objective of availability r
and allows a user who has inadvertently been locked out to use additional authentication
factors to bypass the lockout. c
