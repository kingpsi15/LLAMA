System use notifications are used only for access\nvia logon interfaces with human users. Notifications are not required when human interfaces do\nnot exist. Based on an assessment of risk, organizations consider whether or not a secondary\nsystem use notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after the\ninitial network logon. Organizations consider system use notification messages or banners\ndisplayed in multiple languages based on organizational needs and the demographics of system\nusers. Organizations consult with the privacy office for input regarding privacy messaging and the\nOffice of the General Counsel or organizational equivalent for legal review and approval of\nwarning banner content.\nRelated Controls:  AC-14, PL-4, SI-4.\niControl Enhancements:  None. s\nReferences:  None.b"
