Flow control restrictions include blocking external\nPtraffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information\nfrom being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from 0\n-the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based 5\nron data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an 5\nCA-3). Transferring information agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see\nbetween systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy\npolicies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy\npolicies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy\nenforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific\narchitectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes\nprohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only),\nverifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy\ndomain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 28\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nflows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy\nattributes and labels.\nOrganizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms\nto control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems\nand between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information\nand/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices\nthat employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a\npacket-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability\nbased on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or\ninspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to\ninformation flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-\ndomain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and\nstronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high-T\niassurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf s\nproducts. Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and u\nlDNS). ic\no, Related Controls:  AC-3, AC-6, AC-16, AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, AU-10, CA-3, CA-9, CM-7, PL-9, PM-24\niSA-17, SC-4, SC-7, SC-16, SC-31. s\naControl Enhancements:\nl|  (1) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT OBJECT SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTESe\neAssignment: organization-defined security and privacy attributesUse [] associated with\noAssignment: organization-defined information, source, and destination objects[] to enforce\nAssignment: organization-defined information flow control policies[] as a basis for flow h\nrcontrol decisions. g\nfDiscussion:  Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security and privacy r\nattributes associated with information (i.e., data content and structure) and source and\ndestination objects and respond appropriately when the enforcement mechanisms\nencounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies. For s\n/Secretexample, an information object labeled  would be allowed to flow to a destination d\niSecretTop Secretobject labeled , but an information object labeled  would not be allowed to .\ngSecretflow to a destination object labeled . A dataset of personally identifiable information\n0may be tagged with restrictions against combining with other types of datasets and, thus,\n0would not be allowed to flow to the restricted dataset. Security and privacy attributes can\nalso include source and destination addresses employed in traffic filter firewalls. Flow /\nIenforcement using explicit security or privacy attributes can be used, for example, to control S\nthe release of certain types of information. .\n.Related Controls:  None.\n-|  (2) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT  PROCESSING DOMAINS5\n5Assignment: organization-defined Use protected processing domains to enforce [\ninformation flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.\nDiscussion:  Protected processing domains within systems are processing spaces that have\ncontrolled interactions with other processing spaces, enabling control of information flows\nbetween these spaces and to/from information objects. A protected processing domain can\nbe provided, for example, by implementing domain and type enforcement. In domain and\ntype enforcement, system processes are assigned to domains, information is identified by\ntypes, and information flows are controlled based on allowed information accesses (i.e.,\ndetermined by domain and type), allowed signaling among domains, and allowed process\ntransitions to other domains.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 29\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  SC-39.\n|  (3) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT  DYNAMIC INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL\nAssignment: organization-defined information flow control policiesEnforce [].\nDiscussion:  Organizational policies regarding dynamic information flow control include\nallowing or disallowing information flows based on changing conditions or mission or\noperational considerations.

Data type embedding includes inserting files as objects within other\nfiles and using compressed or archived data types that may include multiple embedded data\ntypes. Limitations on data type embedding consider the levels of embedding and prohibit t\nslevels of data type embedding that are beyond the capability of the inspection tools.\nRelated Controls:  None. o\ng| (6) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT  METADATA\nAssignment: organization-defined metadataEnforce information flow control based on []. .\nDiscussion:  Metadata is information that describes the characteristics of data. Metadata can\nNinclude structural metadata describing data structures or descriptive metadata describing\ndata content. Enforcement of allowed information flows based on metadata enables simpler T\nand more effective flow control. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata\n8regarding data accuracy (i.e., knowledge that the metadata values are correct with respect\nto the data), data integrity (i.e., protecting against unauthorized changes to metadata tags), -\nand the binding of metadata to the data payload (i.e., employing sufficiently strong binding\ntechniques with appropriate assurance).\nRelated Controls:  AC-16, SI-7.\n|-  (7) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT  ONEWAY FLOW MECHANISMS\nEnforce one-way information flows through hardware-based flow control mechanisms.\nDiscussion:  One-way flow mechanisms may also be referred to as a unidirectional network,\nunidirectional security gateway, or data diode.

For example, security or privacy policy filters for data structures can\ncheck for maximum file lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file types (for structured and\nunstructured data). Security or privacy policy filters for data content can check for specific\nwords, enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data\nTpermits the interpretation of data content by applications. Unstructured data refers to\nisdigital information without a data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate\nuthe development of rule sets to address the impact or classification level of the information\nliconveyed by the data or the flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured data consists of c\ntbitmap objects that are inherently non-language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files) and i\ntextual objects that are based on written or printed languages. Organizations can implement\nmore than one security or privacy policy filter to meet information flow control objectives. a\niRelated Controls:  None. la\n|  (9) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT  HUMAN REVIEWS\neAssignment: organization-defined information Enforce the use of human reviews for [\nfflowsAssignment: organization-defined conditions] under the following conditions: [].\naDiscussion:  Organizations define security or privacy policy filters for all situations where\neautomated flow control decisions are possible.
