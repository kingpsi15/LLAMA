  "content": "AC-12 SESSION TERMINATION\nAssignment: organization-defined Control:  Automatically terminate a user session after [\nconditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect].\nDiscussion:  Session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions (in\ncontrast to SC-10, which addresses the termination of network connections associated with\ncommunications sessions (i.e., network disconnect)). A logical session (for local, network, and\nremote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an\nlicorganizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated without terminating network\nisessions. Session termination ends all processes associated with a user\u2019s logical session except o\nfor those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after is\nthe session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events that require automatic termination of the\nsession include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain i\ntypes of incidents, or time-of-day restrictions on system use. le\neRelated Controls:  MA-4, SC-10, SC-23.\nControl Enhancements:\nr|-  (1) SESSION TERMINATION  USERINITIATED LOGOUTSg\nProvide a logout capability for user-initiated communications sessions whenever r\nAssignment: organization-defined information authentication is used to gain access to [\nresources]. t\nDiscussion:  Information resources to which users gain access via authentication include local :\nworkstations, databases, and password-protected websites or web-based services. o\nRelated Controls:  None. r\n| (2) SESSION TERMINATION  TERMINATION MESSAGE .\n2Display an explicit logout message to users indicating the termination of authenticated\nNcommunications sessions.\nTDiscussion:  Logout messages for web access can be displayed after authenticated sessions\nhave been terminated. However, for certain types of sessions, including file transfer protocol P\n(FTP) sessions, systems typically send logout messages as final messages prior to terminating\nsessions. -\nRelated Controls:  None. 5\n| (3) SESSION TERMINATION  TIMEOUT WARNING MESSAGE\nAssignment:  Display an explicit message to users indicating that the session will endin [\norganization-defined time until end of session].\nDiscussion:  To increase usability, notify users of pending session termination and prompt\nusers to continue the session.
