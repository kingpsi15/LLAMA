Types of remote access  m\n:include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks\nt(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted p\n:VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such /\noconnections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in\naccordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, r\n1and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does\n6not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect\nthe ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code.

The ability to authenticate remote commands is\nTimportant for remote systems for which loss, malfunction, misdirection, or exploitation\niwould have immediate or serious consequences, such as injury, death, property damage, s\nuloss of high value assets, failure of mission or business functions, or compromise of classified\nlior controlled unclassified information. Authentication mechanisms for remote commands c\ntensure that systems accept and execute commands in the order intended, execute only i\nauthorized commands, and reject unauthorized commands. Cryptographic mechanisms can\nbe used, for example, to authenticate remote commands. a\niRelated Controls:  SC-12, SC-13, SC-23. la\nReferences:  [SP 800-46], [SP 800-77], [SP 800-113], [SP 800-114], [SP 800-121], [IR 7966]."
