In contrast, access enforcement occurs a\nlwhen systems enforce access control decisions. While it is common to have access control e\nrdecisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not required, and it is e\nnot always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed systems,\ncdifferent entities may make access control decisions and enforce access.\ngRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3.\no Control Enhancements:\nh| (1) ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS  TRANSMIT ACCESS AUTHORIZATION INFORMATION t\nAssignment: organization-defined access authorization informationTransmit [] using :\nAssignment: organization-defined controlsAssignment: organization-defined [] to [o\nosystems] that enforce access control decisions.\n1Discussion:  Authorization processes and access control decisions may occur in separate\n6parts of systems or in separate systems. In such instances, authorization information is\ntransmitted securely (e.g., using cryptographic mechanisms) so that timely access control\ndecisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the access control\ndecisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization information T\nsupporting security and privacy attributes. This is because in distributed systems, there are\n8various access control decisions that need to be made, and different entities make these\ndecisions in a serial fashion, each requiring those attributes to make the decisions. -\nProtecting access authorization information ensures that such information cannot be\naltered, spoofed, or compromised during transmission.\nRelated Controls:  AU-10.\n| (2) ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS  NO USER OR PROCESS IDENTITY\nAssignment: organization-defined security or Enforce access control decisions based on [\nprivacy attributes] that do not include the identity of the user or process acting on behalf\nof the user.\nDiscussion:  In certain situations, it is important that access control decisions can be made\nwithout information regarding the identity of the users issuing the requests. These are\ngenerally instances where preserving individual privacy is of paramount importance.
