Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board\nsensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing\nlocal data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are\ntypically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability\nof the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems,\ndepending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile\ndevices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and\ncontrol such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which\norganizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for\nprotecting information and systems.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 51\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDue to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities,\norganizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage\nrestrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration\nmanagement, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective\nsoftware, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for\ncritical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other\nresident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.\nUsage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For\nexample, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and\nimpose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile\ndevice connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing\nmobile device connections to a system. Adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the\n. Many safeguards for mobile devices are reflected in other requirements specified in AC-19T\nicontrols. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled. s\nbRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-4, AC-7, AC-11, AC-17, AC-18, AC-20, CA-9, CM-2, CM-6, IA-2, IA-3,\nMP-2, MP-4, MP-5, MP-7, PL-4, SC-7, SC-34, SC-43, SI-3, SI-4. a\nControl Enhancements:\n| v(1) ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES  USE OF WRITABLE AND PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-7.]\nf| (2) rACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES  USE OF PERSONALLY OWNED PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-7.] o\n|(3) ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES  USE OF PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES WITH NO a\neIDENTIFIABLE OWNER\no[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-7.]  m\n| (4) ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES  RESTRICTIONS FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATIONt\n(a)Prohibit the use of unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing systems  :\nprocessing, storing, or transmitting classified information unless specifically permitted o\nby the authorizing official; and\n1(b)Enforce the following restrictions on individuals permitted by the authorizing official\n6to use unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing systems processing, storing,\nor transmitting classified information: 8\nI(1)Connection of unclassified mobile devices to classified systems is prohibited;\n.(2)Connection of unclassified mobile devices to unclassified systems requires  S\napproval from the authorizing official; .\n0(3)Use of internal or external modems or wireless interfaces within the unclassified\n3mobile devices is prohibited; and\n(4)Unclassified mobile devices and the information stored on those devices are\nAssignment: organization-defined subject to random reviews and inspections by [\nsecurity officials], and if classified information is found, the incident handling\npolicy is followed.\n(c)Restrict the connection of classified mobile devices to classified systems in accordance\nAssignment: organization-defined security policies with [].\nDiscussion:  None.\nRelated Controls:  CM-8, IR-4.\n|- (5) ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES  FULL DEVICE OR CONTAINERBASED ENCRYPTION\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 52\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSelection: full-device encryption; container-based encryptionEmploy [] to protect the\nAssignment: organization-defined mobile confidentiality and integrity of information on [\ndevices].\nDiscussion:  Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to data and\ninformation encryption on mobile devices, including encrypting selected data structures\nsuch as files, records, or fields.\nRelated Controls:  SC-12,  SC-13, SC-28.\nReferences:  [SP 800-114], [SP 800-124]."
