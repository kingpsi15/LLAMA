Identification of authorized system\nusers and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the\nsecurity plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional\nscrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged\naccess, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security\nofficer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to\nprohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and\nguest accounts.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 19\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWhere access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with\nthe senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role\nmembership; specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for\neach account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational\npolicies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that\ntrigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other\nattributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes\nrequired for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of\norigin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related\nrequirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect\nsystem availability.\nTemporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish\ntemporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for T\nishort-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations s\nestablish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account u\nlactivation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization ic\ntprocesses. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used\naccounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are\nunavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and a\naare not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating\naccounts include when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required b\nand when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group authenticators when\nmembers leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access e\nto the shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training. f\n, Related Controls:  AC-3, AC-5, AC-6, AC-17, AC-18, AC-20, AC-24, AU-2, AU-12, CM-5, IA-2, IA-4\neIA-5, IA-8, MA-3, MA-5, PE-2, PL-4, PS-2, PS-4, PS-5, PS-7, PT-2, PT-3, SC-7, SC-12, SC-13, SC-37.\nmControl Enhancements:\nt| (1) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT  AUTOMATED SYSTEM ACCOUNT MANAGEMENTp\n/Assignment: organization-defined Support the management of system accounts using [/\nautomated mechanisms]. i.\ngDiscussion:  Automated system account management includes using automated mechanisms\n0to create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts; notify account managers when an\n0account is created, enabled, modified, disabled, or removed, or when users are terminated\nor transferred; monitor system account usage; and report atypical system account usage. /\nIAutomated mechanisms can include internal system functions and email, telephonic, and S\ntext messaging notifications. .\n.Related Controls:  None. 8\n-| (2) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT  AUTOMATED TEMPORARY AND EMERGENCY ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT5\n5Selection: remove; disableAutomatically [] temporary and emergency accounts after\nAssignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account[].\nDiscussion:  Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal or\ndisabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period rather than at the\nconvenience of the system administrator.

While user identities remain relatively constant over time, user privileges\n/typically change more frequently based on ongoing mission or business requirements and 1\n.the operational needs of organizations. An example of dynamic privilege management is the 6\n2immediate revocation of privileges from users as opposed to requiring that users terminate\nNand restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can\nalso include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to\nediting specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if\nthey are operating out of their normal work times, if their job function or assignment 8\nchanges, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations. Dynamic privilege\n3management includes the effects of privilege changes, for example, when there are changes\nto encryption keys used for communications.\nRelated Controls:  AC-16.\n| (7) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT  PRIVILEGED USER ACCOUNTS\nSelection: a role-(a)Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with [\nbased access scheme; an attribute-based access scheme];\n(b)Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments;\n(c)Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and\n(d)Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer\nappropriate.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 21\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow\nthose individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not\nauthorized to perform. Privileged roles include key management, account management,\ndatabase administration, system and network administration, and web administration. A\nrole-based access scheme organizes permitted system access and privileges into roles. In\ncontrast, an attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges\nbased on attributes.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (8) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT  DYNAMIC ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT\nAssignment: organization-defined system Create, activate, manage, and deactivate [\naccounts] dynamically.\nDiscussion:  Approaches for dynamically creating, activating, managing, and deactivating\nsystem accounts rely on automatically provisioning the accounts at runtime for entities that is\nwere previously unknown. Organizations plan for the dynamic management, creation,\nactivation, and deactivation of system accounts by establishing trust relationships, business lic\nrules, and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate related authorizations and t\nnprivileges.\nRelated Controls:  AC-16. a\nl| a(9) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT  RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF SHARED AND GROUP ACCOUNTS\nAssignment: organization-Only permit the use of shared and group accounts that meet [\ndefined conditions for establishing shared and group accounts]. e\nfDiscussion:  Before permitting the use of shared or group accounts, organizations consider\nthe increased risk due to the lack of accountability with such accounts. a\neRelated Controls:  None.\nm| (10) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT  SHARED AND GROUP ACCOUNT CREDENTIAL CHANGE\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-2k.] t\n/| (11) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT  USAGE CONDITIONS/\ni.Assignment: organization-defined circumstances and/or usage conditionsEnforce [] for\ngAssignment: organization-defined system accounts[].\nDiscussion:  Specifying and enforcing usage conditions helps to enforce the principle of least .\nprivilege, increase user accountability, and enable effective account monitoring.
