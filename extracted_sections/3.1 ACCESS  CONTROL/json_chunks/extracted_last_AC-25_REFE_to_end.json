A reference validation mechanism is always invoked, tamper-proof,\niand small enough to be subject to analysis and tests, the completeness of which can be assured o\n(i.e., verifiable). Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as is\ndata structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and\npassive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with individuals, devices, or i\nprocesses acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are associated le\nfwith data structures, such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables, files, and inter-r\nprocess pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies that restrict access to objects\nbased on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The system enforces\nthe access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamper-proof a\nproperty of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from compromising the e\nrfunctioning of the reference validation mechanism. The always invoked property prevents o\nadversaries from bypassing the mechanism and violating the security policy. The smallness :\ntproperty helps to ensure completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect\nany weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the\nsecurity policy.\nrRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-16, SA-8, SA-17, SC-3, SC-11, SC-39, SI-13. g\nControl Enhancements:  None. .\nReferences:  None.8\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 58"
