Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts\ninitiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, i\norganization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ\nfdifferent algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those r\ncomponents. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating\nsystem and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the\nnumber of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to a\nanswer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode e\nrwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified o\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying\ntuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)\naddress. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in\nsupport of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to\nohelp prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to\nrespond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is /\nexceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not .\npermitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need. 2\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-9, AU-2, AU-6, IA-5.\nControl Enhancements: S\n| (1) 0UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS  AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT LOCK\n5[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-7.]\n|  (2) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS  PURGE OR WIPE MOBILE DEVICE\nAssignment: organization-defined mobile devicesPurge or wipe information from [] based\nAssignment: organization-defined purging or wiping requirements and techniqueson []\nAssignment: organization-defined numberafter [] consecutive, unsuccessful device logon\nattempts.\nDiscussion:  A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it\ncan be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection;\npossesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained\npower source.
