  "content": "iAC-6 LEAST PRIVILEGE .\n1Control:  Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or\n6processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational\ntasks.\nIDiscussion:  Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and systems. The principle of S\nleast privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring that the processes have access to .\nsystems and operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish organizational\nmissions or business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles,\n5and accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations apply least privilege to the\n5development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems.\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-16, CM-5, CM-11, PL-2, PM-12, SA-8, SA-15, SA-17, SC-38.\nControl Enhancements:\n|  (1) LEAST PRIVILEGE  AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO SECURITY FUNCTIONS\nAssignment: organization-defined individuals or rolesAuthorize access for [] to:\nAssignment: organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, (a)[\nand firmware)]; and\nAssignment: organization-defined security-relevant information(b)[].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 36\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:Security functions include establishing system accounts, configuring access\nauthorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configuring settings for events to be audited,\nand establishing intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes\nfiltering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services,\ncryptographic key management information, and access control lists. Authorized personnel\ninclude security administrators, system administrators, system security officers, system\nprogrammers, and other privileged users.\nRelated Controls:  AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AU-9, PE-2.\n|-  (2) LEAST PRIVILEGE  NONPRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR NONSECURITY FUNCTIONS\nAssignment: organization-Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [\ndefined security functions or security-relevant information] use non-privileged accounts or\nroles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.\nDiscussion:Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity   is\nfunctions limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The\ninclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control lic\npolicies, such as role-based access control, and where a change of role provides the same t\nndegree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and the processes\nacting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-\nprivileged account. a\nbRelated Controls:  AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, PL-4.\nr|  (3)e LEAST PRIVILEGE  NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS\nAssignment: organization-defined privileged commandsAuthorize network access to []\nhAssignment: organization-defined compelling operational needsonly for [] and document\nthe rationale for such access in the security plan for the system. g\nDiscussion:  Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of local access r\n(i.e., user being physically present at the device).\ntRelated Controls:  AC-17, AC-18, AC-19. t\n/|  (4) LEAST PRIVILEGE  SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINSd\nProvide separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges. o\n/Discussion:  Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user 1\n.privileges includes using virtualization techniques to permit additional user privileges within 6\n2a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to the underlying\nNphysical machine, implementing separate physical domains, and employing hardware or\nsoftware domain separation mechanisms.

P\n|  0(5) LEAST PRIVILEGE  PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS\nAssignment: organization-defined personnel Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [\nor roles].\nDiscussion:Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as\nsystem administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems.\nRestricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from\naccessing privileged information or privileged functions. Organizations may differentiate in\nthe application of restricting privileged accounts between allowed privileges for local\naccounts and for domain accounts provided that they retain the ability to control system\nconfigurations for key parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.\nRelated Controls:  IA-2, MA-3, MA-4.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 37\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n|-  (6) LEAST PRIVILEGE  PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NONORGANIZATIONAL USERS\nProhibit privileged access to the system by non-organizational users.\nDiscussion:  An organizational user is an employee or an individual considered by the\norganization to have the equivalent status of an employee. Organizational users include\ncontractors, guest researchers, or individuals detailed from other organizations. A non-\norganizational user is a user who is not an organizational user. Policies and procedures for\ngranting equivalent status of employees to individuals include a need-to-know, citizenship,\nand the relationship to the organization.\nRelated Controls:  AC-18, AC-19, IA-2, IA-8.\n| (7) LEAST PRIVILEGE  REVIEW OF USER PRIVILEGES\nAssignment: organization-defined frequency(a)Review [] the privileges assigned to\nTAssignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users[] to validate the need for\nissuch privileges; and\n(b)Reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission b\nand business needs. a\nDiscussion:  The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time to reflect n\nischanges in organizational mission and business functions, environments of operation,\nvtechnologies, or threats. A periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to\nladetermine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be\nlerevalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.\nRelated Controls:  CA-7.\n|  (8)c LEAST PRIVILEGE  PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR CODE EXECUTION\nrPreventthe following software from executing at higher privilege levels than users\nAssignment: organization-defined software executing the software: [].\nmDiscussion:  In certain situations, software applications or programs need to execute with\nhelevated privileges to perform required functions. However, depending on the software\nfunctionality and configuration, if the privileges required for execution are at a higher level s\n/than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking such applications or programs, d\nithose users may indirectly be provided with greater privileges than assigned. .\nRelated Controls:  None. /\n| (9) LEAST PRIVILEGE  LOG USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS 0\nLog the execution of privileged functions. /\nDiscussion:The misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by\nSauthorized users or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system\n.accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on\n0organizations. Logging and analyzing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect\nsuch misuse and, in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced 3\npersistent threat.\nRelated Controls:  AU-2, AU-3, AU-12.\n|- (10) LEAST PRIVILEGE  PROHIBIT NONPRIVILEGED USERS FROM EXECUTING PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS\nPrevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.\nDiscussion:Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented\nsecurity or privacy controls, establishing system accounts, performing system integrity\nchecks, and administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users\nare individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations.
