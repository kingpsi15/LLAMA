Separation of duties includes\nidividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, s\nconducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security v\nlpersonnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. a\nlBecause separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations e\nrconsider the entirety of systems and system components when developing policy on separation e\nAC-2, of duties. Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in\ncaccess control mechanisms in AC-3, and identity management activities in IA-2, IA-4, and IA-12.\ngRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AU-9, CM-5, CM-11, CP-9, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-12, MA-3, MA-5,\nfPS-2, SA-8, SA-17.\n:Control Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  None. s"
