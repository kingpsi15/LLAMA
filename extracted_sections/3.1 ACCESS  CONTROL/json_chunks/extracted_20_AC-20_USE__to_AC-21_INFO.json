External systems include personally owned\nesystems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in\nocommercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;\n:systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by,\ntoperated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems\n:also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and\nosystems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the\noption to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of\nexternal systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned 1\n.or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems). 6\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships\nIthat have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be S\nsuch that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may .\nnot be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing\n0information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations\n5or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational 5\npersonnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and\nover which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding\nsystem access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be\nuniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.\nTherefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors\nthan on state, local, or tribal governments.\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope\n. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in of AC-20\naccordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and\nconditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 53\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nsystems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be\nprocessed, stored, or transmitted on external systems.

Organizations need assurance i\nthat the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage,\nor otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been a\naimplemented can be achieved by external, independent assessments, attestations, or other\nbmeans, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.\nfRelated Controls:  CA-2.r\no|\u2014 (2) USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS  PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES  RESTRICTED USE\nRestrict the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized a\nAssignment: organization-defined restrictionsindividuals on external systems using [].\nDiscussion:  Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external o\nsystems include restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the :\ntdevices may be used. t\n:Related Controls:  MP-7, SC-41. /\ni.|-\u2014 (3) USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS  NONORGANIZATIONALLY OWNED SYSTEMS   RESTRICTED USE o\n/Restrict the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to process, 1\n.Assignment: organization-defined [store, or transmit organizational information using6\n2restrictions].\nDiscussion:  Non-organizationally owned systems or system components include systems or\nTsystem components owned by other organizations as well as personally owned devices.\nThere are potential risks to using non-organizationally owned systems or components.
