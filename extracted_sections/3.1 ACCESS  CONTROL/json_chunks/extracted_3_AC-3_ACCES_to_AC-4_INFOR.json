In addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level\nand recognizing that systems can host many applications and services in support of mission and r\nbusiness functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and\nservice level to provide increased information security and privacy.

Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized\nindividuals to execute. To reduce the risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating dual\nauthorization duties. Organizations consider the risk associated with implementing dual\nauthorization mechanisms when immediate responses are necessary to ensure public and\nenvironmental safety.\nRelated Controls:  CP-9, MP-6.\n| (3) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT  MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 23\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAssignment: organization-defined mandatory access control policyEnforce [] over the set\nof covered subjects and objects specified in the policy, and where the policy:\n(a)Is uniformly enforced across the covered subjects and objects within the system;\n(b)Specifies that a subject that has been granted access to information is constrained\nfrom doing any of the following;\n(1)Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;\n(2)Granting its privileges to other subjects;\n(3)Changing one or more security attributes (specified by the policy) on subjects,\nobjects, the system, or system components;\n(4)Choosing the security attributes and attribute values (specified by the policy) to\nbe associated with newly created or modified objects; and\n(5)Changing the rules governing access control; and\nAssignment: organization-defined subjects(c)Specifies that [] may explicitly be granted  p\nAssignment: organization-defined privilegesb[] such that they are not limited by any\ndefined subset (or all) of the above constraints. a\nDiscussion:Mandatory access control is a type of nondiscretionary access control.   n\nisMandatory access control policies constrain what actions subjects can take with information\nobtained from objects for which they have already been granted access. This prevents the\nlasubjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. Mandatory\nleaccess control policies constrain actions that subjects can take with respect to the\nepropagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that\noprivilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to\nwhich the system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented. This\nenforcement is provided by an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept as r\nAC-25. The policy is bounded by the system (i.e., once the information is passed described in\noutside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure that the  m\nconstraints on the information remain in effect). h\nsThe trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of\nd). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges necessary least privilege (see AC-6\ni.for satisfying organizational mission/business needs relative to the above policy.

For example, while a mandatory .\naccess control policy imposes a constraint that prevents a subject from passing information 0\nto another subject operating at a different impact or classification level, AC-3(4) permits the\nsubject to pass the information to any other subject with the same impact or classification\nlevel as the subject. Examples of mandatory access control policies include the Bell-LaPadula\npolicy to protect confidentiality of information and the Biba policy to protect the integrity of\ninformation.\nRelated Controls:  SC-7.\n| (4) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT  DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL\nAssignment: organization-defined discretionary access control policyEnforce [] over the set\nof covered subjects and objects specified in the policy, and where the policy specifies that\na subject that has been granted access to information can do one or more of the following:\n(a)Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 24\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(b)Grant its privileges to other subjects;\n(c)Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the system, or the system\u2019s\ncomponents;\n(d)Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects;\n(e)Change the rules governing access control.\nDiscussion:When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not\nconstrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have\nalready been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information\nare not prevented from passing the information to other subjects or objects (i.e., subjects\nhave the discretion to pass). Discretionary access control can operate in conjunction with\nmandatory access control as described in AC-3(3) and AC-3(15). A subject that is constrained\nin its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under the less rigorous h\nAC-3(3) imposes constraints that constraints of discretionary access control. Therefore, while\nbprevent a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different\nAC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any impact or classification level, a\nosubject at the same impact or classification level. The policy is bounded by the system. Once\nithe information is passed outside of system control, additional means may be required to s\nensure that the constraints remain in effect. While traditional definitions of discretionary v\nlaccess control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this a\nlparticular use of discretionary access control. e\neRelated Controls:  None.\nf|-   (5) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT  SECURITYRELEVANT INFORMATION\nAssignment: organization-defined security-relevant informationPrevent access to [] except r\nduring secure, non-operable system states.\nDiscussion:  Security-relevant information is information within systems that can potentially m\nimpact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner h\npthat could result in failure to enforce system security and privacy policies or maintain the\n/separation of code and data. Security-relevant information includes access control lists, /\nfiltering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, and i.\nrcryptographic key management information.

When users are assigned to specific roles, they inherit the authorizations or\nprivileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations\nbecause privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a large number of\nindividuals) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can also increase\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 25\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nprivacy and security risk if individuals assigned to a role are given access to information\nbeyond what they need to support organizational missions or business functions.

For\nexample, if a subject (i.e., user or process acting on behalf of a user) is removed from a\ngroup, access may not be revoked until the next time the object is opened or the next time is\nthe subject attempts to access the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels\nmay take effect immediately. Organizations provide alternative approaches on how to make lic\nrevocations immediate if systems cannot provide such capability and immediate revocation t\nnis necessary.\nRelated Controls:  None. a\nl|  a(9) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT  CONTROLLED RELEASE\nRelease information outside of the system only if:\neAssignment: organization-defined system or system component(a)The receiving []\nfAssignment: organization-defined controlsprovides []; and\naAssignment: organization-defined controls(b)[] are used to validate the appropriateness\neof the information designated for release.\nDiscussion:  Organizations can only directly protect information when it resides within the  m\nsystem. Additional controls may be needed to ensure that organizational information is\ntadequately protected once it is transmitted outside of the system. In situations where the p\nsystem is unable to determine the adequacy of the protections provided by external entities, /\noas a mitigation measure, organizations procedurally determine whether the external systems\nare providing adequate controls. The means used to determine the adequacy of controls r\n1provided by external systems include conducting periodic assessments (inspections/tests),\n6establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations, or\nsome other process. The means used by external entities to protect the information received 8\nneed not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are\nTsufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security and privacy policy to protect the\ninformation and individuals\u2019 privacy. P\nControlled release of information requires systems to implement technical or procedural\nmeans to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For example, if\n5the system passes information to a system controlled by another organization, technical\nmeans are employed to validate that the security and privacy attributes associated with the\nexported information are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the system\npasses information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be\nemployed to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to the printer.\n.

For example, role-\nbased access could be employed to allow access to only a specific type of personally\nidentifiable information within a database rather than allowing access to the database in its is\nentirety.
