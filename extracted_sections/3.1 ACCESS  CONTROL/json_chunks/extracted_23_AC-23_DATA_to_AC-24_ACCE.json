Data storage objects include T\ndatabase records and database fields. Sensitive information can be extracted from data mining\n8operations. When information is personally identifiable information, it may lead to unanticipated\nrevelations about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing data mining -\nactivities, organizations determine whether such activities are authorized. Organizations may be\nsubject to applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that address data\nmining requirements. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy\nand legal counsel regarding such requirements.\nData mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number and frequency of\ndatabase queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of databases,\nlimiting types of responses provided to database queries, applying differential privacy techniques\nor homomorphic encryption, and notifying personnel when atypical database queries or accesses\noccur. Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from data mining while such\nfocuses on monitoring for information resides in organizational data stores.
