Device locks can be\nimplemented at the operating system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be 5\nrused to initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle). User-initiated 5\ndevice locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such, requires users to take physical action to\ninitiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems,\nsuch as when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-7, IA-11, PL-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n|- (1) DEVICE LOCK  PATTERNHIDING DISPLAYS\nConceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly\n. viewable image\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 42\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:The pattern-hiding display can include static or dynamic images, such as\npatterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life\nindicator, or a blank screen with the caveat that controlled unclassified information is not\ndisplayed.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None."
