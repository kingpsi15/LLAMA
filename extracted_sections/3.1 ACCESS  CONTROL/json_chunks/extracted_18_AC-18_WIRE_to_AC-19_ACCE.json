Wireless networks use authentication protocols that i.\nprovide authenticator protection and mutual authentication. g\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-9, CM-7, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, PL-4, SC-40, SC-43, SI-4. .\n8Control Enhancements:\n| (1) WIRELESS ACCESS  AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION\nSelection (one or more): Protect wireless access to the system using authentication of [P\nusers; devices] and encryption.\nDiscussion:  Wireless networking capabilities represent a significant potential vulnerability 5\nrthat can be exploited by adversaries. To protect systems with wireless access points, strong 5\nauthentication of users and devices along with strong encryption can reduce susceptibility to\nthreats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.\nRelated Controls:  SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.\n| (2) WIRELESS ACCESS  MONITORING UNAUTHORIZED CONNECTIONS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4.]\n| (3) WIRELESS ACCESS  DISABLE WIRELESS NETWORKING\nDisable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities embedded within\nsystem components prior to issuance and deployment.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 50\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system components\nrepresent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Disabling\nwireless capabilities when not needed for essential organizational missions or functions can\nreduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (4) WIRELESS ACCESS  RESTRICT CONFIGURATIONS BY USERS\nIdentify and explicitly authorize users allowed to independently configure wireless\nnetworking capabilities.\nDiscussion:  Organizational authorizations to allow selected users to configure wireless\nnetworking capabilities are enforced, in part, by the access enforcement mechanisms\nemployed within organizational systems.\nTRelated Controls:  SC-7, SC-15.\n| p(5) WIRELESS ACCESS  ANTENNAS AND TRANSMISSION POWER LEVELS\nlSelect radio antennas and calibrate transmission power levels to reduce the probability ic\nthat signals from wireless access points can be received outside of organization-controlled t\nboundaries.\naDiscussion:  Actions that may be taken to limit unauthorized use of wireless communications\noutside of organization-controlled boundaries include reducing the power of wireless i\nbtransmissions so that the transmissions are less likely to emit a signal that can be captured\noutside of the physical perimeters of the organization, employing measures such as f\neemissions security to control wireless emanations, and using directional or beamforming\nfantennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended receivers will be able to intercept\nsignals. Prior to taking such mitigating actions, organizations can conduct periodic wireless a\nsurveys to understand the radio frequency profile of organizational systems as well as other\nsystems that may be operating in the area. r\nRelated Controls:  PE-19. :\nReferences:  [SP 800-94], [SP 800-97]."
