Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and\nsubjectspassive. Active entities, also known as , are typically associated with individuals, devices,\nobjectsor processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as , are typically\nassociated with data structures, such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and\ncommunications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions that represent T\nithe basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding s\ninformation. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently or in conjunction with security u\nlattributes, represent the basic properties or characteristics of active or passive entities with ic\nrespect to the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes can be either t\nexplicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems or\nsystem components. a\niAttributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or la\nlreceive information, cause information to flow among objects, or change the system state. These e\nrattributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive\ninformation. The association of attributes to subjects and objects by a system is referred to as\nbinding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Attributes, when c\nabound to data or information, permit the enforcement of security and privacy policies for access\necontrol and information flow control, including data retention limits, permitted uses of\nopersonally identifiable information, and identification of personal information within data\n:objects. Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions or\nmechanisms. The binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength of attribute t\nbinding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques :\nplay important parts in the trust that organizations have in the information flow enforcement o\nprocess. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by\n/organizations. The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of 1\n.individuals to access organizational information. 6\n8Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for systems to support missions or\nIbusiness functions. There are many values that can be assigned to a security attribute. By\nspecifying the permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations ensure that attribute values .\nare meaningful and relevant. Labeling refers to the association of attributes with the subjects\n0and objects represented by the internal data structures within systems. This facilitates system-\nbased enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Labels include classification of 5\ninformation in accordance with legal and compliance requirements (e.g., top secret, secret, 5\nconfidential, controlled unclassified), information impact level; high value asset information,\naccess authorizations, nationality; data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),\npersonally identifiable information processing permissions, including individual consent to\npersonally identifiable information processing, and contractor affiliation. A related term to\nlabeling is marking. Marking refers to the association of attributes with objects in a human-\nreadable form and displayed on system media. Marking enables manual, procedural, or process-\nbased enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Security and privacy labels may\n(Media have the same value as media markings (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential). See MP-3\nMarking).\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 45\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-21, AC-25, AU-2, AU-10, MP-3, PE-22, PT-2, PT-3, PT-4,\nSC-11, SC-16, SI-12, SI-18.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION\nAssignment: organization-Dynamically associate security and privacy attributes with [\ndefined subjects and objectsecurity and privacy policies s] in accordance with the following\nAssignment: organization-defined security and as information is created and combined: [\nprivacy policies].\nDiscussion:Dynamic association of attributes is appropriate whenever the security or\nprivacy characteristics of information change over time. Attributes may change due to\ninformation aggregation issues (i.e., characteristics of individual data elements are different\nTfrom the combined elements), changes in individual access authorizations (i.e., privileges),\nichanges in the security category of information, or changes in security or privacy policies. s\nuAttributes may also change situationally.\nlicRelated Controls:  None.\nn|  (2) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  ATTRIBUTE VALUE CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS\naProvide authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) the capability\nto define or change the value of associated security and privacy attributes. i\nDiscussion:The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of   le\nindividuals to access organizational information.

The integrity of specific items, such as\nrsecurity configuration files, may be maintained through the use of an integrity monitoring\nmechanism that detects anomalies and changes that deviate from \u201cknown good\u201d baselines.\nAutomated policy actions include retention date expirations, access control decisions,\ninformation flow control decisions, and information disclosure decisions. 8\nIRelated Controls:  None.\n|  (4) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  ASSOCIATION OF ATTRIBUTES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS\nAssignment: organization-defined security and privacy Provide the capability to associate [0\n-attributesAssignment: organization-defined subjects and objects] with [] by authorized 5\nrindividuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals).\nDiscussion:Systems, in general, provide the capability for privileged users to assign security\nand privacy attributes to system-defined subjects (e.g., users) and objects (e.g., directories,\nfiles, and ports). Some systems provide additional capability for general users to assign\nsecurity and privacy attributes to additional objects (e.g., files, emails). The association of\nattributes by authorized individuals is described in the design documentation. The support\nprovided by systems can include prompting users to select security and privacy attributes to\nbe associated with information objects, employing automated mechanisms to categorize\ninformation with attributes based on defined policies, or ensuring that the combination of\nthe security or privacy attributes selected is valid. Organizations consider the creation,\ndeletion, or modification of attributes when defining auditable events.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 46\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|  (5) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  ATTRIBUTE DISPLAYS ON OBJECTS TO BE OUTPUT\nDisplay security and privacy attributes in human-readable form on each object that the\nAssignment: organization-defined special system transmits to output devices to identify [\ndissemination, handling, or distribution instructionsAssignment: organization-] using [\ndefined human-readable, standard naming conventions].\nDiscussion:  System outputs include printed pages, screens, or equivalent items. System\noutput devices include printers, notebook computers, video displays, smart phones, and\ntablets.

Organizations t\nscan establish agreements and processes to help ensure that distributed system components\ndimplement attributes with consistent interpretations in automated access enforcement and\nflow enforcement actions. o\n/ Related Controls:  None.1\n0|  (8) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  ASSOCIATION TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES\n/Assignment: organization-defined techniques and technologiesImplement [] in associating N\nsecurity and privacy attributes to information.\nDiscussion:The association of security and privacy attributes to information within systems\n8is important for conducting automated access enforcement and flow enforcement actions.\nThe association of such attributes to information (i.e., binding) can be accomplished with -\ntechnologies and techniques that provide different levels of assurance. For example, systems\ncan cryptographically bind attributes to information using digital signatures that support\ncryptographic keys protected by hardware devices (sometimes known as hardware roots of\ntrust).\nRelated Controls:  SC-12, SC-13.\n|\u2014 (9) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  ATTRIBUTE REASSIGNMENT  REGRADING MECHANISMS\nChange security and privacy attributes associated with information only via regrading\nAssignment: organization-defined techniques or proceduresmechanisms validated using [].\nDiscussion:A regrading mechanism is a trusted process authorized to re-classify and re-label\ndata in accordance with a defined policy exception.

The validation is facilitated by ensuring that regrading mechanisms are single\npurpose and of limited function.
