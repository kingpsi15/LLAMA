Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or\nliauthentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible c\ntfederal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are i\nreceived. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but\namay, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be\nbypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that\nbcommands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored\nuse. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations f\newhere identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather\nfto situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may\ndecide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without\nidentification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be\nf\u201cnone.\u201d r\nRelated Controls:  AC-8, IA-2, PL-2.\nsControl Enhancements:  None.\no| (1) PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION  NECESSARY USESi.\ng[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-14.]\n.References:  None. 6"
