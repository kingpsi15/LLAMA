These\nplatforms all share a common foundation\u2014computers with complex hardware, software and\nfirmware providing a capability that supports the essential mission and business functions of\n2h  organizations.\nbSecurity controls are the safeguards or countermeasures employed within a system or an\naorganization to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its\n3n risk. Privacy controls are the administrative, information and to manage information security\ntechnical, and physical safeguards employed within a system or an organization to manage\na4privacy risks and to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements. Security and\nbprivacy controls are selected and implemented to satisfy security and privacy requirements\nlevied on a system or organization. Security and privacy requirements are derived from f\napplicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and mission needs\nto ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information processed, stored, or c\ntransmitted and to manage risks to individual privacy.\no5 are important tasks The selection, design, and implementation of security and privacy controls m\n:6 that have significant implications for the operations and assets of organizations as well as the\npwelfare of individuals and the Nation. Organizations should answer several key questions when\n/addressing information security and privacy controls:\n\u2022What security and privacy controls are needed to satisfy security and privacy requirements  r\n1and to adequately manage mission/business risks or risks to individuals?\n\u2022Have the selected controls been implemented or is there a plan in place to do so?  2\n\u2022What is the required level of assurance (i.e., grounds for confidence) that the selected  I\n7 controls, as designed and implemented, are effective?.\n1information systemr An  is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing,\nmaintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information [OMB A-130].\n2organization The term  describes an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure\n(e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements).\n3information securitysecurity The two terms  and  are used synonymously in this publication.\n4security privacy controls [OMB A-130] defines and .\n5 Controls provide safeguards and countermeasures in systems security and privacy engineering processes to reduce\nrisk during the system development life cycle.\n6 Organizational operations include mission, functions, image, and reputation.\n7 Security and privacy control effectiveness addresses the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,\noperating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the designated security and\nprivacy requirements [SP 800-53A].\nCHAPTER ONE  PAGE1"
