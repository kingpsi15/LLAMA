IR-3 INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING
pAssignment: Control:  Test the effectiveness of the incident response capability for the system [ u
organization-defined frequencyAssignment: organization-defined ] usingthe following tests: [lic
tests].
Discussion:  Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine their effectiveness is
and identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of
checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, and simulations (parallel or full interrupt). Incident i
response testing can include a determination of the effects on organizational operations and le
fassets and individuals due to incident response. The use of qualitative and quantitative data aids r
in determining the effectiveness of incident response processes.

| m(1) INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING  AUTOMATED TESTING
Assignment: organization-defined automated Test the incident response capability using [t
smechanisms].
Discussion:  Organizations use automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively o
otest incident response capabilities. This can be accomplished by providing more complete
/coverage of incident response issues, selecting realistic test scenarios and environments, and
.stressing the response capability.
Related Controls:  None.
|S (2) INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING  COORDINATION WITH RELATED PLANS
Coordinate incident response testing with organizational elements responsible for related
plans. 8
Discussion:  Organizational plans related to incident response testing include business -
continuity plans, disaster recovery plans, continuity of operations plans, contingency plans, r
crisis communications plans, critical infrastructure plans, and occupant emergency plans.
Related Controls:  None.
| (3) INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING  CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
Use qualitative and quantitative data from testing to:
(a)Determine the effectiveness of incident response processes;
(b)Continuously improve incident response processes; and
(c)Provide incident response measures and metrics that are accurate, consistent, and in a
reproducible format.

Discussion:  To help incident response activities function as intended, organizations may use
metrics and evaluation criteria to assess incident response programs as part of an effort to
continually improve response performance. These efforts facilitate improvement in incident
response efficacy and lessen the impact of incidents.
Related Controls:  None.
