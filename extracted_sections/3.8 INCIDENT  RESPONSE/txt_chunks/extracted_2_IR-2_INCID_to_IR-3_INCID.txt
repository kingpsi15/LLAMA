IR-2 INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING
Control:
a.Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and
responsibilities:
Assignment: organization-defined time period1.Within [] of assuming an incident response
role or responsibility or acquiring system access;
2.When required by system changes; and
Assignment: organization-defined frequency3.[] thereafter; and
Assignment: organization-defined b.Review and update incident response training content [
frequencyAssignment: organization-defined events] and following [].
iDiscussion:  Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities s
of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are u
lincluded in such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to ic
trecognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle i
incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data
collection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response a
atraining includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and
AT-2 or AT-3. internal sources. Incident response training for users may be provided as part of b
Events that may precipitate an update to incident response training content include, but are not
limited to, incident response plan testing or response to an actual incident (lessons learned), e
assessment or audit findings, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, f
hregulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
eRelated Controls:  AT-2, AT-3, AT-4, CP-3, IR-3, IR-4, IR-8, IR-9.
Control Enhancements:
t|  (1) INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING  SIMULATED EVENTSp
/Incorporate simulated events into incident response training to facilitate the required
response by personnel in crisis situations. i.
Discussion:  Organizations establish requirements for responding to incidents in incident
0response plans. Incorporating simulated events into incident response training helps to
0ensure that personnel understand their individual responsibilities and what specific actions
to take in crisis situations. /
Related Controls:  None.
P| (2) INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING  AUTOMATED TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS
Assignment: organization-Provide an incident response training environment using [0
defined automated mechanisms]. 3
Discussion:  Automated mechanisms can provide a more thorough and realistic incident
response training environment.This can be accomplished, for example, by providing more
complete coverage of incident response issues, selecting more realistic training scenarios
and environments, and stressing the response capability.
Related Controls:  None.
|  (3) INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING  BREACH
Provide incident response training on how to identify and respond to a breach, including
the organizationâ€™s process for reporting a breach.

Discussion:  For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally identifiable
information is considered a breach. A breach results in the loss of control, compromise,
unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or a similar occurrence where a person
other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable
information or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such information for
other than authorized purposes. The incident response training emphasizes the obligation of
individuals to report both confirmed and suspected breaches involving information in any
medium or form, including paper, oral, and electronic. Incident response training includes
IR-2(1). tabletop exercises that simulate a breach. See
