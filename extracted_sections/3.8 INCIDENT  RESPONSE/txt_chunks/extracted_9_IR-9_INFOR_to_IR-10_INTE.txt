a method of communication not associated with the spill;
d.Isolating the contaminated system or system component;
e.Eradicating the information from the contaminated system or component;

Discussion:  Information spillage refers to instances where information is placed on systems that
are not authorized to process such information. Information spills occur when information that is
thought to be a certain classification or impact level is transmitted to a system and subsequently h
is determined to be of a higher classification or impact level. At that point, corrective action is
required. The nature of the response is based on the classification or impact level of the spilled b
information, the security capabilities of the system, the specific nature of the contaminated a
ostorage media, and the access authorizations of individuals with authorized access to the
icontaminated system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the s
fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize the risk of v
ifurther spreading the contamination before such contamination is isolated and eradicated. la

Assignment: organization-defined Provide information spillage response training [t
sfrequency].
Discussion:  Organizations establish requirements for responding to information spillage o
oincidents in incident response plans. Incident response training on a regular basis helps to
/ensure that organizational personnel understand their individual responsibilities and what
specific actions to take when spillage incidents occur. .

Discussion:  Corrective actions for systems contaminated due to information spillages may r
be time-consuming. Personnel may not have access to the contaminated systems while
corrective actions are being taken, which may potentially affect their ability to conduct
organizational business.
Related Controls:  None.
