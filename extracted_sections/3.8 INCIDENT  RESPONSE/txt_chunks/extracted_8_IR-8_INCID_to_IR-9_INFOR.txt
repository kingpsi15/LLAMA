Assignment: organization-defined frequency[]; and
Assignment: organization-10.Explicitly designates responsibility for incident response to [
defined entities, personnel, or roles].
Assignment: organization-defined incident b.Distribute copies of the incident response plan to [
response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements];
c.Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or  h
problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;
lAssignment: organization-defined incident d.Communicate incident response plan changes to [ ic
response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; and t
ie.Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.  s
aDiscussion:  It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to
incident response. Organizational mission and business functions determine the structure of b
incident response capabilities. As part of the incident response capabilities, organizations
consider the coordination and sharing of information with external organizations, including
external service providers and other organizations involved in the supply chain. For incidents
hinvolving personally identifiable information (i.e., breaches), include a process to determine
whether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and provide that g
notice accordingly. f

inconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals and any mechanisms to mitigate S
such harms; and .
(c)Identification of applicable privacy requirements.
Discussion:  Organizations may be required by law, regulation, or policy to follow specific r
procedures relating to breaches, including notice to individuals, affected organizations, and
oversight bodies; standards of harm; and mitigation or other specific requirements.
