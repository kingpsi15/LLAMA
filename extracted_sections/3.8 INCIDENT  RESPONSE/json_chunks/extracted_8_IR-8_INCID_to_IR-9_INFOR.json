Organizational mission and business functions determine the structure of b\nincident response capabilities. As part of the incident response capabilities, organizations\nconsider the coordination and sharing of information with external organizations, including\nexternal service providers and other organizations involved in the supply chain. For incidents\nhinvolving personally identifiable information (i.e., breaches), include a process to determine\nwhether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and provide that g\nnotice accordingly. f\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, CP-2, CP-4, IR-4, IR-7, IR-9, PE-6, PL-2, SA-15, SI-12, SR-8. :\nControl Enhancements:\n|  o(1) INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN  BREACHES\nrInclude the following in the Incident Response Plan for breaches involving personally g\nidentifiable information:\n0(a)A process to determine if notice to individuals or other organizations, including\noversight organizations, is needed;\nS(b)An assessment process to determine the extent of the harm, embarrassment,\ninconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals and any mechanisms to mitigate S\nsuch harms; and .\n(c)Identification of applicable privacy requirements.\nDiscussion:  Organizations may be required by law, regulation, or policy to follow specific r\nprocedures relating to breaches, including notice to individuals, affected organizations, and\noversight bodies; standards of harm; and mitigation or other specific requirements.\nRelated Controls:  PT-1, PT-2, PT-3, PT-4, PT-5, PT-7.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-61], [OMB M-17-12]."
