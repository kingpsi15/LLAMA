Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and\nfdevelopment of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can\nbe obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring, a\nand network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An e\nreffective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities\n(e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,\nphysical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function], t\noperations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of\nsuspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain\nincidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational o\nsystems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally /\nidentifiable information is considered a breach. A breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the .\nloss of control, unauthorized acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence where a person 2\n/other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable N\nSinformation or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such information for other\nthan authorized purposes.

Cross-organizational coordination can serve as an important risk b\nmanagement capability.

Supply chain incidents can occur anywhere through or to the supply chain and -\ninclude compromises or breaches that involve primary or sub-tier providers, information\ntechnology products, system components, development processes or personnel, and\nOrganizations consider including processes distribution processes or warehousing facilities.\nfor protecting and sharing incident information in information exchange agreements and\ntheir obligations for reporting incidents to government oversight bodies (e.g., Federal\nAcquisition Security Council).\nRelated Controls:  CA-3, MA-2, SA-9, SR-8.\n| (11) INCIDENT HANDLING  INTEGRATED INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM\nEstablish and maintain an integrated incident response team that can be deployed to any\nAssignment: organization-defined time periodlocation identified by the organization in [].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 154\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  An integrated incident response team is a team of experts that assesses,\ndocuments, and responds to incidents so that organizational systems and networks can\nrecover quickly and implement the necessary controls to avoid future incidents. Incident\nresponse team personnel include forensic and malicious code analysts, tool developers,\nsystems security and privacy engineers, and real-time operations personnel. The incident\nhandling capability includes performing rapid forensic preservation of evidence and analysis\nof and response to intrusions. For some organizations, the incident response team can be a\ncross-organizational entity.\nAn integrated incident response team facilitates information sharing and allows\norganizational personnel (e.g., developers, implementers, and operators) to leverage team\nknowledge of the threat and implement defensive measures that enable organizations to\ndeter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid detection\nof intrusions, the development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective T\nidefensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated team can s\nrapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new u\nlincident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing cyber intelligence ic\ntdevelopment. Integrated incident response teams are better able to identify adversary\ntactics, techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations tempo or specific\nmission and business functions and to define responsive actions in a way that does not a\nadisrupt those mission and business functions. Incident response teams can be distributed\nwithin organizations to make the capability resilient.b\nfRelated Controls:  AT-3.\no| (12) INCIDENT HANDLING  MALICIOUS CODE AND FORENSIC ANALYSIS\nAnalyze malicious code and/or other residual artifacts remaining in the system after the\ngincident.\nrDiscussion:  When conducted carefully in an isolated environment, analysis of malicious code o\nand other residual artifacts of a security incident or breach can give the organization insight :\ntinto adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures. It can also indicate the identity or some\ndefining characteristics of the adversary. In addition, malicious code analysis can help the :\norganization develop responses to future incidents.\nRelated Controls:  None. r\n0| (13) INCIDENT HANDLING  BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS\n2Assignment: Analyze anomalous or suspected adversarial behavior in or related to [\norganization-defined environments or resourcesN].\nTDiscussion:  If the organization maintains a deception environment, an analysis of behaviors\nin that environment, including resources targeted by the adversary and timing of the P\n8incident or event, can provide insight into adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures.\nExternal to a deception environment, the analysis of anomalous adversarial behavior (e.g., -\nchanges in system performance or usage patterns) or suspected behavior (e.g., changes in r\nsearches for the location of specific resources) can give the organization such insight.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (14) INCIDENT HANDLING  SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER\nEstablish and maintain a security operations center.\nDiscussion:  A security operations center (SOC) is the focal point for security operations and\ncomputer network defense for an organization. The purpose of the SOC is to defend and\nmonitor an organization\u2019s systems and networks (i.e., cyber infrastructure) on an ongoing\nbasis. The SOC is also responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity\nincidents in a timely manner. The organization staffs the SOC with skilled technical and\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 155\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\noperational personnel (e.g., security analysts, incident response personnel, systems security\nengineers) and implements a combination of technical, management, and operational\ncontrols (including monitoring, scanning, and forensics tools) to monitor, fuse, correlate,\nanalyze, and respond to threat and security-relevant event data from multiple sources.\nThese sources include perimeter defenses, network devices (e.g., routers, switches), and\nendpoint agent data feeds. The SOC provides a holistic situational awareness capability to\nhelp organizations determine the security posture of the system and organization. A SOC\ncapability can be obtained in a variety of ways. Larger organizations may implement a\ndedicated SOC while smaller organizations may employ third-party organizations to provide\nsuch a capability.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (15) INCIDENT HANDLING  PUBLIC RELATIONS AND REPUTATION REPAIR\nh(a)Manage public relations associated with an incident; and\n(b)Employ measures to repair the reputation of the organization.\nliDiscussion:  It is important for an organization to have a strategy in place for addressing c\ntincidents that have been brought to the attention of the general public, have cast the i\norganization in a negative light, or have affected the organization\u2019s constituents (e.g.,\npartners, customers). Such publicity can be extremely harmful to the organization and affect a\nits ability to carry out its mission and business functions. Taking proactive steps to repair the\nborganization\u2019s reputation is an essential aspect of reestablishing the trust and confidence of\nits constituents. f\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  [FASC18], [41 CFR 201], [OMB M-17-12], [SP 800-61], [SP 800-86], [SP 800-101], [SP h\nr800-150], [SP 800-160-2], [SP 800-184], [IR 7559]. g"
