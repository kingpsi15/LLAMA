Information spills occur when information that is\nthought to be a certain classification or impact level is transmitted to a system and subsequently h\nis determined to be of a higher classification or impact level. At that point, corrective action is\nrequired. The nature of the response is based on the classification or impact level of the spilled b\ninformation, the security capabilities of the system, the specific nature of the contaminated a\nostorage media, and the access authorizations of individuals with authorized access to the\nicontaminated system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the s\nfact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize the risk of v\nifurther spreading the contamination before such contamination is isolated and eradicated. la\nRelated Controls:  CP-2, IR-6, PM-26, PM-27, PT-2, PT-3, PT-7, RA-7.\nControl Enhancements:\nh| (1) INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE  RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into IR-9.] e\n| m(2) INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE  TRAINING\nAssignment: organization-defined Provide information spillage response training [t\nsfrequency].\nDiscussion:  Organizations establish requirements for responding to information spillage o\noincidents in incident response plans.
