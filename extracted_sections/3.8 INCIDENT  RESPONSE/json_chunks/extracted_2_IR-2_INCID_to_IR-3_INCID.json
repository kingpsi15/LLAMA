For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to ic\ntrecognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle i\nincidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data\ncollection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response a\natraining includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and\nAT-2 or AT-3. internal sources. Incident response training for users may be provided as part of b\nEvents that may precipitate an update to incident response training content include, but are not\nlimited to, incident response plan testing or response to an actual incident (lessons learned), e\nassessment or audit findings, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, f\nhregulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\neRelated Controls:  AT-2, AT-3, AT-4, CP-3, IR-3, IR-4, IR-8, IR-9.\nControl Enhancements:\nt|  (1) INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING  SIMULATED EVENTSp\n/Incorporate simulated events into incident response training to facilitate the required\nresponse by personnel in crisis situations. i.\nDiscussion:  Organizations establish requirements for responding to incidents in incident\n0response plans. Incorporating simulated events into incident response training helps to\n0ensure that personnel understand their individual responsibilities and what specific actions\nto take in crisis situations. /\nRelated Controls:  None.\nP| (2) INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING  AUTOMATED TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS\nAssignment: organization-Provide an incident response training environment using [0\ndefined automated mechanisms]. 3\nDiscussion:  Automated mechanisms can provide a more thorough and realistic incident\nresponse training environment.This can be accomplished, for example, by providing more\ncomplete coverage of incident response issues, selecting more realistic training scenarios\nand environments, and stressing the response capability.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|  (3) INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING  BREACH\nProvide incident response training on how to identify and respond to a breach, including\nthe organization\u2019s process for reporting a breach.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 150\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally identifiable\ninformation is considered a breach. A breach results in the loss of control, compromise,\nunauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or a similar occurrence where a person\nother than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable\ninformation or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such information for\nother than authorized purposes. The incident response training emphasizes the obligation of\nindividuals to report both confirmed and suspected breaches involving information in any\nmedium or form, including paper, oral, and electronic. Incident response training includes\nIR-2(1). tabletop exercises that simulate a breach. See\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB M-17-12], [SP 800-50]."
