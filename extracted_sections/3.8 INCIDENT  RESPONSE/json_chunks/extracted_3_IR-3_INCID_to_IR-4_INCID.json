Incident response testing includes the use of\nchecklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, and simulations (parallel or full interrupt). Incident i\nresponse testing can include a determination of the effects on organizational operations and le\nfassets and individuals due to incident response. The use of qualitative and quantitative data aids r\nin determining the effectiveness of incident response processes.\nRelated Controls:  CP-3, CP-4, IR-2, IR-4, IR-8, PM-14. h\nControl Enhancements: e\n| m(1) INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING  AUTOMATED TESTING\nAssignment: organization-defined automated Test the incident response capability using [t\nsmechanisms].\nDiscussion:  Organizations use automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively o\notest incident response capabilities. This can be accomplished by providing more complete\n/coverage of incident response issues, selecting realistic test scenarios and environments, and\n.stressing the response capability.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|S (2) INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING  COORDINATION WITH RELATED PLANS\nCoordinate incident response testing with organizational elements responsible for related\nplans. 8\nDiscussion:  Organizational plans related to incident response testing include business -\ncontinuity plans, disaster recovery plans, continuity of operations plans, contingency plans, r\ncrisis communications plans, critical infrastructure plans, and occupant emergency plans.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (3) INCIDENT RESPONSE TESTING  CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\nUse qualitative and quantitative data from testing to:\n(a)Determine the effectiveness of incident response processes;\n(b)Continuously improve incident response processes; and\n(c)Provide incident response measures and metrics that are accurate, consistent, and in a\nreproducible format.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 151\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  To help incident response activities function as intended, organizations may use\nmetrics and evaluation criteria to assess incident response programs as part of an effort to\ncontinually improve response performance. These efforts facilitate improvement in incident\nresponse efficacy and lessen the impact of incidents.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-84], [SP 800-115]."
