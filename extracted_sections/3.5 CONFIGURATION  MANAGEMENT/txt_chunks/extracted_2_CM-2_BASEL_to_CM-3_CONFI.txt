CM-2 BASELINE CONFIGURATION
Control:
a.Develop, document, and maintain under configuration control, a current baseline
configuration of the system; and
b.Review and update the baseline configuration of the system:
Assignment: organization-defined frequency1.[];
Assignment: organization-defined circumstances2.When required due to []; and
3.When system components are installed or upgraded.
Discussion:  Baseline configurations for systems and system components include connectivity,
operational, and communications aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, T
iformally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for systems or configuration items within s
those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to u
lsystems and include security and privacy control implementations, operational procedures, ic
tinformation about system components, network topology, and logical placement of components i
in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines
as organizational systems change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect the a
acurrent enterprise architecture.

gDiscussion:  Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline
configurations for systems include configuration management tools, hardware, software, 0
firmware inventory tools, and network management tools. Automated tools can be used at 0

baseline configuration activities. 5

| (6) BASELINE CONFIGURATION  DEVELOPMENT AND TEST ENVIRONMENTS
Maintain a baseline configuration for system development and test environments that is
managed separately from the operational baseline configuration.
Discussion:  Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing, and
operational environments protects systems from unplanned or unexpected events related to
development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow organizations to
apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of configuration.
For example, the management of operational configurations typically emphasizes the need
for stability, while the management of development or test configurations requires greater h
flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror configurations in the operational
environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of b
the proposed changes to the operational systems. Separate baseline configurations do not a
onecessarily require separate physical environments.

fDiscussion:  When it is known that systems or system components will be in high-risk areas
mexternal to the organization, additional controls may be implemented to counter the
hincreased threat in such areas. For example, organizations can take actions for notebook
computers used by individuals departing on and returning from travel. Actions include s
/determining the locations that are of concern, defining the required configurations for the d
icomponents, ensuring that components are configured as intended before travel is initiated, .
gand applying controls to the components after travel is completed. Specially configured
0notebook computers include computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and
0more stringent configuration settings. Controls applied to mobile devices upon return from
travel include examining the mobile device for signs of physical tampering and purging and
Ireimaging disk drives. Protecting information that resides on mobile devices is addressed in S
