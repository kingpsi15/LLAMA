nCM-4 IMPACT ANALYSES
Control:  Analyze changes to the system to determine potential security and privacy impacts v
iprior to change implementation. la
Discussion:  Organizational personnel with security or privacy responsibilities conduct impact
analyses. Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary skills and technical
expertise to analyze the changes to systems as well as the security or privacy ramifications.
Impact analyses include reviewing security and privacy plans, policies, and procedures to h
runderstand control requirements; reviewing system design documentation and operational g
procedures to understand control implementation and how specific system changes might affect f
mthe controls; reviewing the impact of changes on organizational supply chain partners with
hstakeholders; and determining how potential changes to a system create new risks to the privacy
of individuals and the ability of implemented controls to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses
also include risk assessments to understand the impact of the changes and determine if /
additional controls are required. i.

| N(1) IMPACT ANALYSES  SEPARATE TEST ENVIRONMENTS
TAnalyze changes to the system in a separate test environment before implementation in
an operational environment, looking for security and privacy impacts due to flaws, P
weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice.
Discussion:  A separate test environment requires an environment that is physically or 5
rlogically separate and distinct from the operational environment. The separation is sufficient 5
to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact activities in the operational
environment and that information in the operational environment is not inadvertently
transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or
logical means. If physically separate test environments are not implemented, organizations
determine the strength of mechanism required when implementing logical separation.

After system changes, verify that the impacted controls are implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the
security and privacy requirements for the system.
Discussion:  Implementation in this context refers to installing changed code in the
operational system that may have an impact on security or privacy controls.
