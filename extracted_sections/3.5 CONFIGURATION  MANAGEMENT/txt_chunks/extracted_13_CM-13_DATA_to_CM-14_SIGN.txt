CM-13 DATA ACTION MAPPING
Control:  Develop and document a map of system data actions.
Discussion:  Data actions are system operations that process personally identifiable information.
The processing of such information encompasses the full information life cycle, which includes
collection, generation, transformation, use, disclosure, retention, and disposal. A map of system

data actions includes discrete data actions, elements of personally identifiable information being
processed in the data actions, system components involved in the data actions, and the owners
or operators of the system components. Understanding what personally identifiable information
is being processed (e.g., the sensitivity of the personally identifiable information), how personally
identifiable information is being processed (e.g., if the data action is visible to the individual or is
processed in another part of the system), and by whom (e.g., individuals may have different
privacy perceptions based on the entity that is processing the personally identifiable information)
provides a number of contextual factors that are important to assessing the degree of privacy
risk created by the system. Data maps can be illustrated in different ways, and the level of detail
may vary based on the mission and business needs of the organization. The data map may be an
overlay of any system design artifact that the organization is using. The development of this map
may necessitate coordination between the privacy and security programs regarding the covered
data actions and the components that are identified as part of the system.
