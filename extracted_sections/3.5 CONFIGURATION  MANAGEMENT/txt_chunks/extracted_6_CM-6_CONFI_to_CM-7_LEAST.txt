SDiscussion:  Configuration settings are the parameters that can be changed in the hardware,
software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security and privacy posture or S
functionality of the system. Information technology products for which configuration settings can .
be defined include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, operating systems, mobile 0
devices, input/output devices, protocols, and applications. Parameters that impact the security 3
posture of systems include registry settings; account, file, or directory permission settings; and
settings for functions, protocols, ports, services, and remote connections. Privacy parameters are
parameters impacting the privacy posture of systems, including the parameters required to
satisfy other privacy controls. Privacy parameters include settings for access controls, data
processing preferences, and processing and retention permissions. Organizations establish
organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings
for systems. The established settings become part of the configuration baseline for the system.
Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists, lockdown and
hardening guides, and security reference guides) provide recognized, standardized, and
established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology

products and platforms as well as instructions for configuring those products or platforms to
meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of
organizations, including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors,
federal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in the public and private
sectors.
Implementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the organization level,
mission and business process level, system level, or at a higher level, including by a regulatory
agency. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration
] and security technical implementation guides (STIGs), which affect the Baseline [USGCB
implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content
Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol provide an effective
method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings.

bDiscussion:  Automated tools (e.g., hardening tools, baseline configuration tools) can
improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of configuration settings information.
Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities, alerting e
mechanisms, and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization. f
