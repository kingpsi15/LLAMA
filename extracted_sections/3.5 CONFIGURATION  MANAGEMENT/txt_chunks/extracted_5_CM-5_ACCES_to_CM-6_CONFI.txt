CM-5 ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE
Control:  Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions
associated with changes to the system.
hDiscussion:  Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems or the
operational procedures related to the system can potentially have significant effects on the p
bsecurity of the systems or individualsâ€™ privacy. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and
authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes. Access restrictions a
AC-3 and PE-3), software libraries, workflow include physical and logical access controls (see
iautomation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e., changes implemented into external interfaces s
vrather than directly into systems), and change windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified
ltimes). a
Related Controls:  AC-3, AC-5, AC-6, CM-9, PE-3, SC-28, SC-34, SC-37, SI-2, SI-10.

Assignment: organization-defined automated e(a)Enforce access restrictions using [
mechanisms]; and  o
(b)Automatically generate audit records of the enforcement actions.
pDiscussion:  Organizations log system accesses associated with applying configuration
changes to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to support after-/
the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes. i.

Assignment: organization-Enforce dual authorization for implementing changes to [r
defined system components and system-level information].
Discussion:  Organizations employ dual authorization to help ensure that any changes to
selected system components and information cannot occur unless two qualified individuals
approve and implement such changes. The two individuals possess the skills and expertise to
determine if the proposed changes are correct implementations of approved changes. The
individuals are also accountable for the changes. Dual authorization may also be known as
two-person control. To reduce the risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating dual
authorization duties to other individuals. System-level information includes operational
procedures.
Related Controls:  AC-2, AC-5, CM-3.

| (5) ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE  PRIVILEGE LIMITATION FOR PRODUCTION AND OPERATION
(a)Limit privileges to change system components and system-related information within
a production or operational environment; and
Assignment: organization-defined frequency(b)Review and reevaluate privileges [].
Discussion:  In many organizations, systems support multiple mission and business functions.
Limiting privileges to change system components with respect to operational systems is
necessary because changes to a system component may have far-reaching effects on mission
and business processes supported by the system. The relationships between systems and
mission/business processes are, in some cases, unknown to developers. System-related
information includes operational procedures.
Related Controls:  AC-2.
