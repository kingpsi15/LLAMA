Discussion:  Configuration management activities occur throughout the system development life
cycle. As such, there are developmental configuration management activities (e.g., the control of
code and software libraries) and operational configuration management activities (e.g., control
of installed components and how the components are configured). Configuration management
plans satisfy the requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored to

individual systems. Configuration management plans define processes and procedures for how
configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities.
Configuration management plans are generated during the development and acquisition stage of
the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to advance changes through change
management processes; update configuration settings and baselines; maintain component
inventories; control development, test, and operational environments; and develop, release, and
update key documents.
Organizations can employ templates to help ensure the consistent and timely development and
implementation of configuration management plans. Templates can represent a configuration
management plan for the organization with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by
system basis. Configuration management approval processes include the designation of key
stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and
personnel who conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the implementation of h
changes to the systems. Configuration items are the system components, such as the hardware,
bsoftware, firmware, and documentation to be configuration-managed. As systems continue
through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may be identified, and some a
oexisting configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control.

|  (1) CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN  ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY f
Assign responsibility for developing the configuration management process to
organizational personnel that are not directly involved in system development.
Discussion: In the absence of dedicated configuration management teams assigned within
organizations, system developers may be tasked with developing configuration management
oprocesses using personnel who are not directly involved in system development or system
:integration. This separation of duties ensures that organizations establish and maintain a
tsufficient degree of independence between the system development and integration p
:processes and configuration management processes to facilitate quality control and more /
oeffective oversight.
