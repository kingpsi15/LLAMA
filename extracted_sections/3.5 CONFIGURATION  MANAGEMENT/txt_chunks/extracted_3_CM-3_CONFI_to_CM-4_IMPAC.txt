CM-3 CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL
Control:
a.Determine and document the types of changes to the system that are configuration-
controlled;
b.Review proposed configuration-controlled changes to the system and approve or disapprove
such changes with explicit consideration for security and privacy impact analyses;
c.Document configuration change decisions associated with the system;
d.Implement approved configuration-controlled changes to the system;

Discussion:  Configuration change control for organizational systems involves the systematic
proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of system changes,
including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to
baseline configurations, configuration items of systems, operational procedures, configuration T
isettings for system components, remediate vulnerabilities, and unscheduled or unauthorized s
changes. Processes for managing configuration changes to systems include Configuration Control u
lBoards or Change Advisory Boards that review and approve proposed changes. For changes that ic
impact privacy risk, the senior agency official for privacy updates privacy impact assessments and t
system of records notices. For new systems or major upgrades, organizations consider including
representatives from the development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards or a
aChange Advisory Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after changes are

Test, validate, and document changes to the system before finalizing the implementation
of the changes.
Discussion:  Changes to systems include modifications to hardware, software, or firmware
components and configuration settings defined in CM-6. Organizations ensure that testing
does not interfere with system operations that support organizational mission and business
functions. Individuals or groups conducting tests understand security and privacy policies
and procedures, system security and privacy policies and procedures, and the health, safety,
and environmental risks associated with specific facilities or processes. Operational systems

during planned system outages whenever possible. If the testing cannot be conducted on
operational systems, organizations employ compensating controls.

aDiscussion:  Information security and privacy representatives include system security
officers, senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, or i
bsystem privacy officers. Representation by personnel with information security and privacy
expertise is important because changes to system configurations can have unintended side f
eeffects, some of which may be security- or privacy-relevant. Detecting such changes early in
fthe process can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect
the security and privacy posture of systems. The configuration change control element a

Discussion:  The controls referenced in the control enhancement refer to security and
privacy controls from the control catalog. Regardless of the cryptographic mechanisms
employed, processes and procedures are in place to manage those mechanisms. For
example, if system components use certificates for identification and authentication, a
process is implemented to address the expiration of those certificates.
