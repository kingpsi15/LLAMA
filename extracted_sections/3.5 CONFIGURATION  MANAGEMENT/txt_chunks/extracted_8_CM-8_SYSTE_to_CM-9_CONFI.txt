5.Includesthe following information to achieve system component accountability:
Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective [
system component accountability]; and
Assignment: organization-defined b.Review and update the system component inventory [
frequency].
Discussion:  System components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets that
include hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations may choose to implement centralized
system component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such
situations, organizations ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required
for component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of system
components includes the system name, software owners, software version numbers, hardware T
iinventory specifications, software license information, and for networked components, the s
machine names and network addresses across all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). u
lInventory specifications include date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, ic
supplier information, component type,  and physical location. t
iPreventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of accountability that s
occurs when component ownership and system association is not known, especially in large or v
icomplex connected systems. Effective prevention of duplicate accounting of system components la
lnecessitates use of a unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally e
rmanaged software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component of the system
on which it is installed and managed. Software installed on multiple organizational systems and
managed at the system level is addressed for each individual system and may appear more than c
aonce in a centralized component inventory, necessitating a system association for each software
eto avoid duplicate accounting of components. Scanning instance in the centralized inventory
osystems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6) can result in duplicate
: can components being identified in different address spaces. The implementation of CM-8(7)
help to eliminate duplicate accounting of components. t

and system updates.
Discussion:  Organizations can improve the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of
8system component inventories if the inventories are updated as part of component
installations or removals or during general system updates. If inventories are not updated at
3these key times, there is a greater likelihood that the information will not be appropriately
captured and documented. System updates include hardware, software, and firmware
components.

Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanismscomponents using [].
Discussion:  Organizations maintain system inventories to the extent feasible. For example,
virtual machines can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not visible to the
network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and

(one or more): disable network access by such components; isolate the components;

TDiscussion:  Automated unauthorized component detection is applied in addition to the
imonitoring for unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring for s
uunauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the
liperiodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms may also be used to c

can be implemented in systems or in separate system components. When acquiring and
implementing automated mechanisms, organizations consider whether such mechanisms a
depend on the ability of the system component to support an agent or supplicant in order to
bbe detected since some types of components do not have or cannot support agents (e.g., IoT
devices, sensors). Isolation can be achieved , for example, by placing unauthorized system f
components in separate domains or subnets or quarantining such components. This type of  e
component isolation is commonly referred to as “sandboxing.” f

sadministering those components.
Discussion:  Identifying individuals who are responsible and accountable for administering o
osystem components ensures that the assigned components are properly administered and
/that organizations can contact those individuals if some action is required (e.g., when the 1

Discussion:  Organizations may implement centralized system component inventories that
include components from all organizational systems. Centralized repositories of component
inventories provide opportunities for efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware,
software, and firmware assets. Such repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify
the location and responsible individuals of components that have been compromised,
breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. Organizations ensure that the
resulting centralized inventories include system-specific information required for proper
component accountability.
Related Controls:  None.
| (8) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY  AUTOMATED LOCATION TRACKING
Assignment: Support the tracking of system components by geographic location using [
organization-defined automated mechanisms].
Discussion:  The use of automated mechanisms to track the location of system components is
can increase the accuracy of component inventories. Such capability may help organizations
rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system components that have lic
been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. The use of t
ntracking mechanisms can be coordinated with senior agency officials for privacy if there are
implications that affect individual privacy.
