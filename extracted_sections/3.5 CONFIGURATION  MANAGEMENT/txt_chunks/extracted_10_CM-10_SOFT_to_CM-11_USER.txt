|- (1) SOFTWARE USAGE RESTRICTIONS  OPENSOURCE SOFTWARE
Assignment: Establish the following restrictions on the use of open-source software: [
organization-defined restrictions].
Discussion:  Open-source software refers to software that is available in source code form.
Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely provided under
software license agreements that permit individuals to study, change, and improve the
software. From a security perspective, the major advantage of open-source software is that
it provides organizations with the ability to examine the source code. In some cases, there is
an online community associated with the software that inspects, tests,  updates, and reports
on issues found in software on an ongoing basis. However, remediating vulnerabilities in
open-source software may be problematic. There may also be licensing issues associated
hwith open-source software, including the constraints on derivative use of such software.
Open-source software that is available only in binary form may increase the level of risk in p
busing such software.
