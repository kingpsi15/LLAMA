Discussion:  Configuration management policy and procedures address the controls in the CM :
family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is o
an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures
/contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy 1
.programs collaborate on the development of configuration management policy and procedures. 6
2Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in
Ngeneral, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The
policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by
multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established
for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. 8
Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the
3individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system
security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an
update to configuration management policy and procedures include, but are not limited to,
assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,
executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating
controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.
Related Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.
Control Enhancements:  None.
