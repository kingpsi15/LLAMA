Discussion:  Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and
services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational
missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple
services from a single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services
provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality
to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary
software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent
unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations
employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point
protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify
and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least functionality
SA-can also be achieved as part of the fundamental design and development of the system (see
8, SC-2, and SC-3).

rsoftware, and services within the system deemed to be unnecessary and/or e

Discussion:  Organizations review functions, ports, protocols, and services provided by h
rsystems or system components to determine the functions and services that are candidates g
for elimination. Such reviews are especially important during transition periods from older
technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transition from IPv4 to IPv6). These technology m
transitions may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously h
pduring the transition period and returning to minimum essential functions, ports, protocols,
/and services at the earliest opportunity. Organizations can either decide the relative security /
of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the i.
rassessment of other entities. Unsecure protocols include Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer g
networking. 0

5Discussion:  Prevention of program execution addresses organizational policies, rules of
behavior, and/or access agreements that restrict software usage and the terms and
conditions imposed by the developer or manufacturer, including software licensing and
copyrights. Restrictions include prohibiting auto-execute features, restricting roles allowed
to approve program execution, permitting or prohibiting specific software programs, or
restricting the number of program instances executed at the same time.

unauthorized software programs on the system; and

be applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges, websites, and
MAC addresses. b

Discussion:  Authorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or from a
fspecific source. To facilitate a comprehensive authorized software process and increase the r
strength of protection for attacks that bypass application level authorized software, software
programs may be decomposed into and monitored at different levels of detail. These levels t
sinclude applications, application programming interfaces, application modules, scripts,
dsystem processes, system services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link
i.libraries. The concept of permitting the execution of authorized software may also be o
applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges, websites, and MAC
addresses. Organizations consider verifying the integrity of authorized software programs
0using digital signatures, cryptographic checksums, or hash functions. Verification of
authorized software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup. The /

potential for containing malicious code. For this type of software, user installations occur in
confined environments of operation to limit or contain damage from malicious code that

Organizations assess software products without accompanying source code or from sources
with limited or no warranty for potential security impacts. The assessments address the fact a
that software products without the provision of source code may be difficult to review,
repair, or extend. In addition, there may be no owners to make such repairs on behalf of
eorganizations. If open-source software is used, the assessments address the fact that there is
ono warranty, the open-source software could contain back doors or malware, and there may
be no support available. h
