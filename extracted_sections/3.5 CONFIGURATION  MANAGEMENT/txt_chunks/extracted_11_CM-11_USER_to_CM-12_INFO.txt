pDiscussion:  If provided the necessary privileges, users can install software in organizational
systems. To maintain control over the software installed, organizations identify permitted and /
prohibited actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations include i.
updates and security patches to existing software and downloading new applications from g
organization-approved “app stores.” Prohibited software installations include software with 0
unknown or suspect pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially malicious. 0
8Policies selected for governing user-installed software are organization-developed or provided by
some external entity. Policy enforcement methods can include procedural methods and I
automated methods.
