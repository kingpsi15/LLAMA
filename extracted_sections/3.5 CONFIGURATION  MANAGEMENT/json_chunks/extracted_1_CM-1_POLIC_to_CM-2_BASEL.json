The risk management strategy is o\nan important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures\n/contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy 1\n.programs collaborate on the development of configuration management policy and procedures. 6\n2Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in\nNgeneral, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The\npolicy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by\nmultiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established\nfor security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. 8\nProcedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the\n3individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system\nsecurity and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an\nupdate to configuration management policy and procedures include, but are not limited to,\nassessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,\nexecutive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating\ncontrols does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 96\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
