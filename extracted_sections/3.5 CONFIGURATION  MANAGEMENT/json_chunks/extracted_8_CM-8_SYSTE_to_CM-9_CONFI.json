Organizations may choose to implement centralized\nsystem component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such\nsituations, organizations ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required\nfor component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of system\ncomponents includes the system name, software owners, software version numbers, hardware T\niinventory specifications, software license information, and for networked components, the s\nmachine names and network addresses across all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). u\nlInventory specifications include date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, ic\nsupplier information, component type,  and physical location. t\niPreventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of accountability that s\noccurs when component ownership and system association is not known, especially in large or v\nicomplex connected systems. Effective prevention of duplicate accounting of system components la\nlnecessitates use of a unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally e\nrmanaged software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component of the system\non which it is installed and managed. Software installed on multiple organizational systems and\nmanaged at the system level is addressed for each individual system and may appear more than c\naonce in a centralized component inventory, necessitating a system association for each software\neto avoid duplicate accounting of components. Scanning instance in the centralized inventory\nosystems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6) can result in duplicate\n: can components being identified in different address spaces. The implementation of CM-8(7)\nhelp to eliminate duplicate accounting of components. t\n/Related Controls:  CM-2, CM-7, CM-9, CM-10, CM-11, CM-13, CP-2, CP-9, MA-2, MA-6, PE-20, PL-d\ni9, PM-5, SA-4, SA-5, SI-2, SR-4. .\n/Control Enhancements: 1\n|0 (1) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY  UPDATES DURING INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL\n/Update the inventory of system components as part of component installations, removals, N\nand system updates.\nDiscussion:  Organizations can improve the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of\n8system component inventories if the inventories are updated as part of component\ninstallations or removals or during general system updates. If inventories are not updated at\n3these key times, there is a greater likelihood that the information will not be appropriately\ncaptured and documented. System updates include hardware, software, and firmware\ncomponents.\nRelated Controls:  PM-16.\n| (2) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY  AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE\nMaintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the inventory of system\nAssignment: organization-defined automated mechanismscomponents using [].\nDiscussion:  Organizations maintain system inventories to the extent feasible. For example,\nvirtual machines can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not visible to the\nnetwork when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 108\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\naccurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable.

Monitoring for s\nuunauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the\nliperiodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms may also be used to c\ntCM-7(9)). Automated mechanisms prevent the connection of unauthorized components (see i\ncan be implemented in systems or in separate system components. When acquiring and\nimplementing automated mechanisms, organizations consider whether such mechanisms a\ndepend on the ability of the system component to support an agent or supplicant in order to\nbbe detected since some types of components do not have or cannot support agents (e.g., IoT\ndevices, sensors). Isolation can be achieved , for example, by placing unauthorized system f\ncomponents in separate domains or subnets or quarantining such components. This type of  e\ncomponent isolation is commonly referred to as \u201csandboxing.\u201d f\naRelated Controls:  AC-19, CA-7, RA-5, SC-3, SC-39, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.\n| (4) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY  ACCOUNTABILITY INFORMATION f\nInclude in the system component inventory information, a means for identifying by\nSelection (one or more): name; position; role[], individuals responsible and accountable for t\nsadministering those components.\nDiscussion:  Identifying individuals who are responsible and accountable for administering o\nosystem components ensures that the assigned components are properly administered and\n/that organizations can contact those individuals if some action is required (e.g., when the 1\n.component is determined to be the source of a breach, needs to be recalled or replaced, or\n2needs to be relocated).\nRelated Controls:  AC-3.\n.| (5) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY  NO DUPLICATE ACCOUNTING OF COMPONENTSS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-8.]8\n5| (6) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY  ASSESSED CONFIGURATIONS AND APPROVED DEVIATIONS\nInclude assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to current\ndeployed configurations in the system component inventory.\nDiscussion: Assessed configurations and approved deviations focus on configuration settings\nestablished by organizations for system components, the specific components that have\nbeen assessed to determine compliance with the required configuration settings, and any\napproved deviations from established configuration settings.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (7) SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY  CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY\nProvide a centralized repository for the inventory of system components.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 109\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  Organizations may implement centralized system component inventories that\ninclude components from all organizational systems. Centralized repositories of component\ninventories provide opportunities for efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware,\nsoftware, and firmware assets. Such repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify\nthe location and responsible individuals of components that have been compromised,\nbreached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions.

Such capability may help organizations\nrapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system components that have lic\nbeen compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation actions.
