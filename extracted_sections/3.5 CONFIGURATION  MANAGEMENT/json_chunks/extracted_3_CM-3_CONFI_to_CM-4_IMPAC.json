Configuration change control includes changes to\nbaseline configurations, configuration items of systems, operational procedures, configuration T\nisettings for system components, remediate vulnerabilities, and unscheduled or unauthorized s\nchanges. Processes for managing configuration changes to systems include Configuration Control u\nlBoards or Change Advisory Boards that review and approve proposed changes. For changes that ic\nimpact privacy risk, the senior agency official for privacy updates privacy impact assessments and t\nsystem of records notices. For new systems or major upgrades, organizations consider including\nrepresentatives from the development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards or a\naChange Advisory Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after changes are\nSA-10. made to systems and the auditing activities required to implement such changes.

Representation by personnel with information security and privacy\nexpertise is important because changes to system configurations can have unintended side f\neeffects, some of which may be security- or privacy-relevant. Detecting such changes early in\nfthe process can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect\nthe security and privacy posture of systems.
