Baseline configurations are documented, T\niformally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for systems or configuration items within s\nthose systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to u\nlsystems and include security and privacy control implementations, operational procedures, ic\ntinformation about system components, network topology, and logical placement of components i\nin the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines\nas organizational systems change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect the a\nacurrent enterprise architecture.\nlRelated Controls:  AC-19, AU-6, CA-9, CM-1, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-8, CM-9, CP-9, CP-10, CP-12, e\nrMA-2, PL-8, PM-5, SA-8, SA-10, SA-15, SC-18. e\nControl Enhancements: f\n| (1) BASELINE CONFIGURATION  REVIEWS AND UPDATES r\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-2.] f\n| :(2) BASELINE CONFIGURATION  AUTOMATION SUPPORT FOR ACCURACY AND CURRENCY\npMaintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the baseline\n/Assignment: organization-defined automated configuration of the system using [/\nmechanisms].\ngDiscussion:  Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline\nconfigurations for systems include configuration management tools, hardware, software, 0\nfirmware inventory tools, and network management tools. Automated tools can be used at 0\n8the organization level, mission and business process level, or system level on workstations,\nservers, notebook computers, network components, or mobile devices. Tools can be used to I\ntrack version numbers on operating systems, applications, types of software installed, and .\nPcurrent patch levels. Automation support for accuracy and currency can be satisfied by the\n0CM-8(2) for organizations that combine system component inventory and implementation of\nbaseline configuration activities. 5\n5Related Controls:  CM-7, IA-3, RA-5.\n| (3) BASELINE CONFIGURATION  RETENTION OF PREVIOUS CONFIGURATIONS\nAssignment: organization-defined numberRetain [] of previous versions of baseline\nconfigurations of the system to support rollback.\nDiscussion:  Retaining previous versions of baseline configurations to support rollback\ninclude hardware, software, firmware, configuration files, configuration records, and\nassociated documentation.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (4) BASELINE CONFIGURATION  UNAUTHORIZED SOFTWARE\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 97\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-7(4).]\n| (5) BASELINE CONFIGURATION  AUTHORIZED SOFTWARE\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-7(5).]\n| (6) BASELINE CONFIGURATION  DEVELOPMENT AND TEST ENVIRONMENTS\nMaintain a baseline configuration for system development and test environments that is\nmanaged separately from the operational baseline configuration.\nDiscussion:  Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing, and\noperational environments protects systems from unplanned or unexpected events related to\ndevelopment and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow organizations to\napply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of configuration.\nFor example, the management of operational configurations typically emphasizes the need\nfor stability, while the management of development or test configurations requires greater h\nflexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror configurations in the operational\nenvironment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of b\nthe proposed changes to the operational systems. Separate baseline configurations do not a\nonecessarily require separate physical environments.\nisRelated Controls:  CM-4, SC-3, SC-7.\n|- (7) BASELINE CONFIGURATION  CONFIGURE SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS FOR HIGHRISK AREAS i\nlAssignment: organization-defined systems or system components(a)Issue [] with  e\nrAssignment: organization-defined configurations[] to individuals traveling to locations e\nthat the organization deems to be of significant risk; and\n(b)Apply the following controls to the systems or components when the individuals  h\nrAssignment: organization-defined controlsreturn from travel: [].\nfDiscussion:  When it is known that systems or system components will be in high-risk areas\nmexternal to the organization, additional controls may be implemented to counter the\nhincreased threat in such areas. For example, organizations can take actions for notebook\ncomputers used by individuals departing on and returning from travel. Actions include s\n/determining the locations that are of concern, defining the required configurations for the d\nicomponents, ensuring that components are configured as intended before travel is initiated, .\ngand applying controls to the components after travel is completed. Specially configured\n0notebook computers include computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and\n0more stringent configuration settings. Controls applied to mobile devices upon return from\ntravel include examining the mobile device for signs of physical tampering and purging and\nIreimaging disk drives. Protecting information that resides on mobile devices is addressed in S\nMP (Media Protection) family. the .\nRelated Controls:  MP-4, MP-5. .\n-References:  [SP 800-124], [SP 800-128]."
