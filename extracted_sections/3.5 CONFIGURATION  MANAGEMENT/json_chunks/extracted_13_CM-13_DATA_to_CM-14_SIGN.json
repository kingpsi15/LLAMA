A map of system\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 113\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\ndata actions includes discrete data actions, elements of personally identifiable information being\nprocessed in the data actions, system components involved in the data actions, and the owners\nor operators of the system components. Understanding what personally identifiable information\nis being processed (e.g., the sensitivity of the personally identifiable information), how personally\nidentifiable information is being processed (e.g., if the data action is visible to the individual or is\nprocessed in another part of the system), and by whom (e.g., individuals may have different\nprivacy perceptions based on the entity that is processing the personally identifiable information)\nprovides a number of contextual factors that are important to assessing the degree of privacy\nrisk created by the system. Data maps can be illustrated in different ways, and the level of detail\nmay vary based on the mission and business needs of the organization. The data map may be an\noverlay of any system design artifact that the organization is using. The development of this map\nmay necessitate coordination between the privacy and security programs regarding the covered\ndata actions and the components that are identified as part of the system.\ni.
