From a security perspective, the major advantage of open-source software is that\nit provides organizations with the ability to examine the source code. In some cases, there is\nan online community associated with the software that inspects, tests,  updates, and reports\non issues found in software on an ongoing basis. However, remediating vulnerabilities in\nopen-source software may be problematic. There may also be licensing issues associated\nhwith open-source software, including the constraints on derivative use of such software.\nOpen-source software that is available only in binary form may increase the level of risk in p\nbusing such software.\nRelated Controls:  SI-7. t\nReferences:  None.i s"
