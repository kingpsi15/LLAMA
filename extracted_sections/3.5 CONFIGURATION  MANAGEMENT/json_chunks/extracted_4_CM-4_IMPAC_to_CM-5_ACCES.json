Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary skills and technical\nexpertise to analyze the changes to systems as well as the security or privacy ramifications.\nImpact analyses include reviewing security and privacy plans, policies, and procedures to h\nrunderstand control requirements; reviewing system design documentation and operational g\nprocedures to understand control implementation and how specific system changes might affect f\nmthe controls; reviewing the impact of changes on organizational supply chain partners with\nhstakeholders; and determining how potential changes to a system create new risks to the privacy\nof individuals and the ability of implemented controls to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses\nalso include risk assessments to understand the impact of the changes and determine if /\nadditional controls are required. i.\n/Related Controls:  CA-7, CM-3, CM-8, CM-9, MA-2, RA-3, RA-5, RA-8, SA-5, SA-8, SA-10, SI-2.\nControl Enhancements: 0\n| N(1) IMPACT ANALYSES  SEPARATE TEST ENVIRONMENTS\nTAnalyze changes to the system in a separate test environment before implementation in\nan operational environment, looking for security and privacy impacts due to flaws, P\nweaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice.\nDiscussion:  A separate test environment requires an environment that is physically or 5\nrlogically separate and distinct from the operational environment. The separation is sufficient 5\nto ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact activities in the operational\nenvironment and that information in the operational environment is not inadvertently\ntransmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or\nlogical means. If physically separate test environments are not implemented, organizations\ndetermine the strength of mechanism required when implementing logical separation.\nRelated Controls:  SA-11, SC-7.\n| (2) IMPACT ANALYSES  VERIFICATION OF CONTROLS\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 101\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAfter system changes, verify that the impacted controls are implemented correctly,\noperating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the\nsecurity and privacy requirements for the system.\nDiscussion:  Implementation in this context refers to installing changed code in the\noperational system that may have an impact on security or privacy controls.\nRelated Controls:  SA-11, SC-3, SI-6.\nReferences:  [SP 800-128]."
