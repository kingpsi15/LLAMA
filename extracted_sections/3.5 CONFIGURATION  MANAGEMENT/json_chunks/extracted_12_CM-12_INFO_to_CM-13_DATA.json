Information location includes identifying where specific information types b\nand information reside in system components and how information is being processed so that\ninformation flow can be understood and adequate protection and policy management provided e\nfor such information and system components. The security category of the information is also a f\nhfactor in determining the controls necessary to protect the information and the system\ngFIPS 199). The location of the information and component where the information resides (see\nfsystem components is also a factor in the architecture and design of the system (see SA-4, SA-8,\nSA-17).\ntRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-23, CM-8, PM-5, RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-17, SC-4, SC-\n:16, SC-28, SI-4, SI-7./ /\niControl Enhancements: .\n|1 (1) INFORMATION LOCATION  AUTOMATED TOOLS TO SUPPORT INFORMATION LOCATION\nAssignment: organization-defined information by Use automated tools to identify [0\n8information typeAssignment: organization-defined system components] on [] to ensure\ncontrols are in place to protect organizational information and individual privacy. I\nDiscussion:  The use of automated tools helps to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of .\nthe information location capability implemented within the system. Automation also helps\norganizations manage the data produced during information location activities and share\n5such information across the organization. The output of automated information location\n5tools can be used to guide and inform system architecture and design decisions.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  [FIPS 199], [SP 800-60-1], [SP 800-60-2]."
