As such, there are developmental configuration management activities (e.g., the control of\ncode and software libraries) and operational configuration management activities (e.g., control\nof installed components and how the components are configured). Configuration management\nplans satisfy the requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored to\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 110\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nindividual systems. Configuration management plans define processes and procedures for how\nconfiguration management is used to support system development life cycle activities.\nConfiguration management plans are generated during the development and acquisition stage of\nthe system development life cycle. The plans describe how to advance changes through change\nmanagement processes; update configuration settings and baselines; maintain component\ninventories; control development, test, and operational environments; and develop, release, and\nupdate key documents.\nOrganizations can employ templates to help ensure the consistent and timely development and\nimplementation of configuration management plans. Templates can represent a configuration\nmanagement plan for the organization with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by\nsystem basis. Configuration management approval processes include the designation of key\nstakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and\npersonnel who conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the implementation of h\nchanges to the systems. Configuration items are the system components, such as the hardware,\nbsoftware, firmware, and documentation to be configuration-managed. As systems continue\nthrough the system development life cycle, new configuration items may be identified, and some a\noexisting configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control.\n.

This separation of duties ensures that organizations establish and maintain a\ntsufficient degree of independence between the system development and integration p\n:processes and configuration management processes to facilitate quality control and more /\noeffective oversight.\nrRelated Controls:  None. g\nReferences:  [SP 800-128]. ."
