Information technology products for which configuration settings can .\nbe defined include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, operating systems, mobile 0\ndevices, input/output devices, protocols, and applications. Parameters that impact the security 3\nposture of systems include registry settings; account, file, or directory permission settings; and\nsettings for functions, protocols, ports, services, and remote connections. Privacy parameters are\nparameters impacting the privacy posture of systems, including the parameters required to\nsatisfy other privacy controls. Privacy parameters include settings for access controls, data\nprocessing preferences, and processing and retention permissions. Organizations establish\norganization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings\nfor systems. The established settings become part of the configuration baseline for the system.\nCommon secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists, lockdown and\nhardening guides, and security reference guides) provide recognized, standardized, and\nestablished benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 103\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nproducts and platforms as well as instructions for configuring those products or platforms to\nmeet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of\norganizations, including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors,\nfederal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in the public and private\nsectors.\nImplementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the organization level,\nmission and business process level, system level, or at a higher level, including by a regulatory\nagency. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration\n] and security technical implementation guides (STIGs), which affect the Baseline [USGCB\nimplementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content\nAutomation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol provide an effective\nmethod to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-19, AU-2, AU-6, CA-9, CM-2, CM-3, CM-5, CM-7, CM-11, CP-7, CP-9, h\nCP-10, IA-3, IA-5, PL-8, PL-9, RA-5, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-9, SC-18, SC-28, SC-43, SI-2, SI-4, SI-6.\nlControl Enhancements: ic\no|,, (1) CONFIGURATION SETTINGS  AUTOMATED MANAGEMENT APPLICATION AND VERIFICATION\nAssignment: organization-defined Manage, apply, and verify configuration settings for [\nsystem componentsAssignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms] using []. a\nbDiscussion:  Automated tools (e.g., hardening tools, baseline configuration tools) can\nimprove the accuracy, consistency, and availability of configuration settings information.\nAutomation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities, alerting e\nmechanisms, and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization. f\nRelated Controls:  CA-7.a\n| (2) CONFIGURATION SETTINGS  RESPOND TO UNAUTHORIZED CHANGES f\nAssignment: Take the following actions in response to unauthorized changes to [\norganization-defined configuration settingsAssignment: organization-defined actions]: []. t\nDiscussion:  Responses to unauthorized changes to configuration settings include alerting :\ndesignated organizational personnel, restoring established configuration settings, or\u2014in o\noextreme cases\u2014halting affected system processing.\n1Related Controls:  IR-4, IR-6, SI-7.\n| (3) CONFIGURATION SETTINGS  UNAUTHORIZED CHANGE DETECTION2\nN[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-7.]\n| (4) .CONFIGURATION SETTINGS  CONFORMANCE DEMONSTRATION\n.[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-4.] 8\n-References:  [SP 800-70], [SP 800-126], [SP 800-128], [USGCB], [NCPR], [DOD STIG]. 5"
