Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and\nauthorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes.

The two individuals possess the skills and expertise to\ndetermine if the proposed changes are correct implementations of approved changes. The\nindividuals are also accountable for the changes. Dual authorization may also be known as\ntwo-person control. To reduce the risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating dual\nauthorization duties to other individuals.

The relationships between systems and\nmission/business processes are, in some cases, unknown to developers.
