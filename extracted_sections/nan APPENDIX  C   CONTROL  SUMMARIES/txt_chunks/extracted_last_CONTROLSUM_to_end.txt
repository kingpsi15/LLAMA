CONTROLSUMMARIES
IMPLEMENTATION, WITHDRAWAL, AND ASSURANCE DESIGNATIONS
Tables C-1 through C-20 provide a summary of the security and privacy controls and control
enhancements in Chapter Three. Each table focuses on a different control family.
•A control or control enhancement that has been withdrawn from the control catalog is
indicated by a “W” and an explanation of the control or control enhancement disposition in
light gray text.
•hA control or control enhancement that is typically implemented by an information system
implemented bythrough technical means is indicated by an “S” in the  column. p
li•cA control or control enhancement that is typically implemented by an organization (i.e., by
iimplemented byan individual through nontechnical means) is indicated by an “O” in the  o
35i column.s
a•A control or control enhancement that can be implemented by an organization, a system, or
ba combination of the two is indicated by an “O/S.”
e•assuranceA control or control enhancement marked with a “√” in the  column indicates the
control or control enhancement contributes to the grounds for confidence that a security or
h36 privacy claim has been or will be achieved.
fEach control and control enhancement in Tables C-1 through C-20 is hyperlinked to the text for r
. that control and control enhancement in Chapter Three
pFamilies of controls contain base controls and control enhancements, which are directly related
/to their base controls. Control enhancements either add functionality or specificity to a base
icontrol or increase the strength of a base control. In both cases, control enhancements are used .
in systems and environments of operation that require greater protection than provided by the
base control. This increased protection is required due to the potential adverse organizational or .
individual impacts or when organizations require additions to the base control functionality or 2
assurance based on organizational assessments of risk. The use of control enhancements  Nalways
requires the use of the base control. T
8The families are arranged in alphabetical order, while the controls and control enhancements
within each family are arranged in numerical order. The alphabetical or numerical order of the -
rfamilies, controls, and control enhancements does  imply any type of prioritization, level of not
importance, or order in which the controls or control enhancements are to be implemented.
35systemorganization The indication that a certain control or control enhancement is implemented by a  or by an  in
Tables C-1 through C-20 is notional. Organizations have the flexibility to implement their selected controls and control
enhancements in the most cost-effective and efficient manner while simultaneously complying with the intent of the
controls or control enhancements. In certain situations, a control or control enhancement may be implemented by
the system, the organization, or a combination of the two entities.
36 Assurance is a critical aspect in determining the trustworthiness of systems. Assurance is the measure of confidence
that the security and privacy functions, features, practices, policies, procedures, mechanisms, and architecture of
organizational systems accurately mediate and enforce established security and privacy policies.
