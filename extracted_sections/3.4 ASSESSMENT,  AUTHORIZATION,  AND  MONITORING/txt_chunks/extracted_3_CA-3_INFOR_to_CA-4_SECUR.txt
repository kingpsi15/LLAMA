Discussion:  System information exchange requirements apply to information exchanges
between two or more systems. System information exchanges include connections via leased
lines or virtual private networks, connections to internet service providers, database sharing or
exchanges of database transaction information, connections and exchanges with cloud services,
exchanges via web-based services, or exchanges of files via file transfer protocols, network
protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6), email, or other organization-to-organization communications. T
iOrganizations consider the risk related to new or increased threats that may be introduced when s
systems exchange information with other systems that may have different security and privacy u
lrequirements and controls. This includes systems within the same organization and systems that ic
are external to the organization. A joint authorization of the systems exchanging information, as t
CA-6(1) or CA-6(2), may help to communicate and reduce risk. described in
Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with system information exchange and the v
icontrols needed for appropriate risk mitigation. The types of agreements selected are based on la
lfactors such as the impact level of the information being exchanged, the relationship between e
rthe organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to
business, business to business, government or business to service provider, government or
business to individual), or the level of access to the organizational system by users of the other c
asystem. If systems that exchange information have the same authorizing official, organizations
eneed not develop agreements. Instead, the interface characteristics between the systems (e.g.,
ohow the information is being exchanged. how the information is protected) are described in the
:respective security and privacy plans. If the systems that exchange information have different
authorizing officials within the same organization, the organizations can develop agreements or t
provide the same information that would be provided in the appropriate agreement type from :
in the respective security and privacy plans for the systems. Organizations may incorporate CA-3ao
agreement information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established
/between federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (including service providers, contractors, 1
.system developers, and system integrators). Risk considerations include systems that share the 6
2same networks.

| (6) INFORMATION EXCHANGE  TRANSFER AUTHORIZATIONS
Verify that individuals or systems transferring data between interconnecting systems have
the requisite authorizations (i.e., write permissions or privileges) prior to accepting such
data.
Discussion:  To prevent unauthorized individuals and systems from making information
transfers to protected systems, the protected system verifies—via independent means—
whether the individual or system attempting to transfer information is authorized to do so.
Verification of the authorization to transfer information also applies to control plane traffic
(e.g., routing and DNS) and services (e.g., authenticated SMTP relays).

| (7) INFORMATION EXCHANGE TRANSITIVE INFORMATION EXCHANGES h
p(a)Identify transitive (downstream) information exchanges with other systems through
CA-3a; and the systems identified in
(b)Take measures to ensure that transitive (downstream) information exchanges cease  t
when the controls on identified transitive (downstream) systems cannot be verified or
validated.
Discussion:  Transitive or “downstream” information exchanges are information exchanges i
bbetween the system or systems with which the organizational system exchanges information
and other systems. For mission-essential systems, services, and applications, including high f
evalue assets, it is necessary to identify such information exchanges. The transparency of the
fcontrols or protection measures in place in such downstream systems connected directly or
indirectly to organizational systems is essential to understanding the security and privacy a
risks resulting from those information exchanges. Organizational systems can inherit risk
from downstream systems through transitive connections and information exchanges, which r
can make the organizational systems more susceptible to threats, hazards, and adverse
impacts. t
