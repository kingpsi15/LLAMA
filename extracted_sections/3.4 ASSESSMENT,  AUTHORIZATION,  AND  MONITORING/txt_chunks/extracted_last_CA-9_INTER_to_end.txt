Discussion:  Internal system connections are connections between organizational systems and
8separate constituent system components (i.e., connections between components that are part of
the same system) including components used for system development. Intra-system connections -
include connections with mobile devices, notebook and desktop computers, tablets, printers,
copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each internal
system connection individually, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of
system components with common characteristics and/or configurations, including printers,
scanners, and copiers with a specified processing, transmission, and storage capability or smart
phones and tablets with a specific baseline configuration. The continued need for an internal
system connection is reviewed from the perspective of whether it provides support for
organizational missions or business functions.

|  (1) INTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS  COMPLIANCE CHECKS
Perform security and privacy compliance checks on constituent system components prior
to the establishment of the internal connection.
Discussion:  Compliance checks include verification of the relevant baseline configuration.
