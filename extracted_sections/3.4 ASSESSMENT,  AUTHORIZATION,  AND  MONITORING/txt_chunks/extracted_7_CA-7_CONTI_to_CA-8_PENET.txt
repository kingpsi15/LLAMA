Discussion:  Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the
system security and privacy posture to support organizational risk management decisions. The
terms “continuous” and “ongoing” imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls
and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may
require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring generate risk
response actions by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that
have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to determine the
specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain
the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation
with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having
access to security and privacy information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards T
igives organizational officials the ability to make effective and timely risk management decisions, s
including ongoing authorization decisions. u
Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware inventories, a
oauthorization packages, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when
icontinuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, s
actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with v
lthe security categories of systems. Monitoring requirements, including the need for specific a
lAC-monitoring, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements, such as AC-2g, e

Control Enhancements: :
i| (1). CONTINUOUS MONITORING  INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT
Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to monitor the controls in the system /
on an ongoing basis. .
2Discussion:  Organizations maximize the value of control assessments by requiring that
Nassessments be conducted by assessors with appropriate levels of independence. The level
of required independence is based on organizational continuous monitoring strategies. T
Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to the monitoring process. To
8achieve such impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the
organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as
management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in
advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their services.

| (3) CONTINUOUS MONITORING  TREND ANALYSES
Employ trend analyses to determine if control implementations, the frequency of
continuous monitoring activities, and the types of activities used in the continuous
monitoring process need to be modified based on empirical data.

Discussion:  Trend analyses include examining recent threat information that addresses the
types of threat events that have occurred in the organization or the Federal Government,
success rates of certain types of attacks, emerging vulnerabilities in technologies, evolving
social engineering techniques, the effectiveness of configuration settings, results from
multiple control assessments, and findings from Inspectors General or auditors.
Related Controls:  None.
| (4) CONTINUOUS MONITORING  RISK MONITORING
Ensure risk monitoring is an integral part of the continuous monitoring strategy that
includes the following:
Effectiveness monitoring; (a)
Compliance monitoring; and (b)
Change monitoring. (c) h
Discussion:  Risk monitoring is informed by the established organizational risk tolerance. p
bEffectiveness monitoring determines the ongoing effectiveness of the implemented risk
response measures. Compliance monitoring verifies that required risk response measures a
are implemented. It also verifies that security and privacy requirements are satisfied. Change
ismonitoring identifies changes to organizational systems and environments of operation that
vmay affect security and privacy risk.
Related Controls:  None.
f| (5) rCONTINUOUS MONITORING  CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS
Employ the following actions to validate that policies are established and implemented o
cAssignment: organization-defined actionscontrols are operating in a consistent manner: [].
Discussion:  Security and privacy controls are often added incrementally to a system. As a g
result, policies for selecting and implementing controls may be inconsistent, and the controls f
mcould fail to work together in a consistent or coordinated manner. At a minimum, the lack of
hconsistency and coordination could mean that there are unacceptable security and privacy
gaps in the system. At worst, it could mean that some of the controls implemented in one
/location or by one component are actually impeding the functionality of other controls (e.g.,
encrypting internal network traffic can impede monitoring). In other situations, failing to i.
consistently monitor all implemented network protocols (e.g., a dual stack of IPv4 and IPv6) g
may create unintended vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by adversaries. 0
It is important to validate—through testing, monitoring, and analysis—that the implemented 0
8controls are operating in a consistent, coordinated, non-interfering manner.
Related Controls:  None. S

Discussion:  Using automated tools for monitoring helps to maintain the accuracy, currency,
and availability of monitoring information which in turns helps to increase the level of
ongoing awareness of the system security and privacy posture in support of organizational
risk management decisions.
