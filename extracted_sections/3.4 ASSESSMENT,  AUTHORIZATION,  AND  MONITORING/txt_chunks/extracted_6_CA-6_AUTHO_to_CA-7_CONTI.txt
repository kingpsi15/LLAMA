/Discussion:  Authorizations are official management decisions by senior officials to authorize /
operation of systems, authorize the use of common controls for inheritance by organizational i.
rsystems, and explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other g
organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of agreed-upon controls. Authorizing 0
officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational systems and common controls or assume 0
8responsibility for the mission and business functions supported by those systems or common
controls. The authorization process is a federal responsibility, and therefore, authorizing officials I
must be federal employees. Authorizing officials are both responsible and accountable for
Psecurity and privacy risks associated with the operation and use of organizational systems.
Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize systems and senior officials 0
-that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities. 5
Authorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on evidence produced from
implemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce
the need for separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive
continuous monitoring processes, the information contained in authorization packages (i.e.,
security and privacy plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on
an ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, common control providers, and system
owners with an up-to-date status of the security and privacy posture of their systems, controls,
and operating environments. To reduce the cost of reauthorization, authorizing officials can
leverage the results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the
basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.

Control Enhancements:
|—- (1) AUTHORIZATION  JOINT AUTHORIZATION  INTRAORGANIZATION
Employ a joint authorization process for the system that includes multiple authorizing
officials from the same organization conducting the authorization.
Discussion:  Assigning multiple authorizing officials from the same organization to serve as
co-authorizing officials for the system increases the level of independence in the risk-based
decision-making process. It also implements the concepts of separation of duties and dual
authorization as applied to the system authorization process. The intra-organization joint
authorization process is most relevant for connected systems, shared systems, and systems
with multiple information owners.
Related Controls:  AC-6.
|—- (2) AUTHORIZATION  JOINT AUTHORIZATION  INTERORGANIZATION u
liEmploy a joint authorization process for the system that includes multiple authorizing c
officials with at least one authorizing official from an organization external to the i
organization conducting the authorization.
Discussion:  Assigning multiple authorizing officials, at least one of whom comes from an v
iexternal organization, to serve as co-authorizing officials for the system increases the level of la
independence in the risk-based decision-making process. It implements the concepts of le
separation of duties and dual authorization as applied to the system authorization process. r
Employing authorizing officials from external organizations to supplement the authorizing
official from the organization that owns or hosts the system may be necessary when the c
aexternal organizations have a vested interest or equities in the outcome of the authorization
edecision. The inter-organization joint authorization process is relevant and appropriate for
connected systems, shared systems or services, and systems with multiple information o
owners. The authorizing officials from the external organizations are key stakeholders of the :
tsystem undergoing authorization. t
