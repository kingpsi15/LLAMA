CA-8 PENETRATION TESTING
Assignment: organization-defined frequencyControl:  Conduct penetration testing [] on
Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components[].
Discussion:  Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or
individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries.
Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents
and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network,
operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate
vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries
within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration
testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of
security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially
himportant when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies
(e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). p
liOrganizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing c
tactivities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, i
software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical
controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes a pretest analysis based on full a
knowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest
banalysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All parties agree
to the rules of engagement before commencing penetration testing scenarios. Organizations f
correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques, and e
procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries. Penetration testing may result in f
the exposure of information that is protected by laws or regulations, to individuals conducting
gthe testing. Rules of engagement, contracts, or other appropriate mechanisms can be used to
fcommunicate expectations for how to protect this information. Risk assessments guide the r
decisions on the level of independence required for the personnel conducting penetration
testing.

Employ the following red-team exercises to simulate attempts by adversaries to
compromise organizational systems in accordance with applicable rules of engagement:
Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises[].
Discussion:  Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by examining
the security and privacy posture of organizations and the capability to implement effective
cyber defenses. Red team exercises simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise
mission and business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the security and

privacy posture of systems and organizations. Such attempts may include technology-based
attacks and social engineering-based attacks. Technology-based attacks include interactions
with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission and business processes.
Social engineering-based attacks include interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing,
or personal conversations. Red team exercises are most effective when conducted by
penetration testing agents and teams with knowledge of and experience with current
adversarial tactics, techniques, procedures, and tools. While penetration testing may be
primarily laboratory-based testing, organizations can use red team exercises to provide more
comprehensive assessments that reflect real-world conditions. The results from red team
exercises can be used by organizations to improve security and privacy awareness and
training and to assess control effectiveness.

bfrequencySelection: announced; unannounced] [] attempts to bypass or circumvent
acontrols associated with physical access points to the facility.
nDiscussion:  Penetration testing of physical access points can provide information on critical
vulnerabilities in the operating environments of organizational systems. Such information
can be used to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in physical controls that are necessary to a
protect organizational systems.
