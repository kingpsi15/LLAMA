CA-2 CONTROL ASSESSMENTS
Control:
a.Select the appropriate assessor or assessment team for the type of assessment to be
conducted;
b.Develop a control assessment plan that describes the scope of the assessment including:
1.Controls and control enhancements under assessment;
2.Assessment procedures to be used to determine control effectiveness; and
h3.Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities;
c.Ensure the control assessment plan is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or  u
ldesignated representative prior to conducting the assessment; ic
oAssignment: d.Assess the controls in the system and its environment of operation [
iorganization-defined frequency] to determine the extent to which the controls are s
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with v
lrespect to meeting established security and privacy requirements; a
e.Produce a control assessment report that document the results of the assessment; and
Assignment: organization-defined f.Provide the results of the control assessment to [
individuals or roles]. c
gDiscussion:  Organizations ensure that control assessors possess the required skills and technical
expertise to develop effective assessment plans and to conduct assessments of system-specific, f
mhybrid, common, and program management controls, as appropriate. The required skills include
hgeneral knowledge of risk management concepts and approaches as well as comprehensive
knowledge of and experience with the hardware, software, and firmware system components s
/implemented. d
Organizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those systems operate
/as part of initial and ongoing authorizations, continuous monitoring, FISMA annual assessments, 1
.system design and development, systems security engineering, privacy engineering, and the 6
2system development life cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet information
Nsecurity and privacy requirements, identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the system design and
development process, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part T
of authorization processes, and comply with vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations
conduct assessments on the implemented controls as documented in security and privacy plans. 8
Assessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of
3systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for controls can be
assessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design reviews conducted. If a design
to implement controls and subsequent implementation in accordance with the design are
assessed during development, the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing
previously completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes.
Organizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment plan for the
system or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment plan clearly delineates the roles
and responsibilities for control assessment. If multiple organizations participate in assessing a
system, a coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.
Organizations can use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and
system monitoring, to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the system

life cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail, as deemed
necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and
whether the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
desired outcome with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the
individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example,
assessments conducted in support of authorization decisions are provided to authorizing
officials, senior agency officials for privacy, senior agency information security officers, and
authorizing official designated representatives.
To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the
following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations, continuous monitoring, systems
engineering processes, or system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that
assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control effectiveness, and
obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control assessment T
iresults can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented s
with additional assessments as needed. After the initial authorizations, organizations assess u
lcontrols during continuous monitoring. Organizations also establish the frequency for ongoing ic
tassessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. External audits,
. including audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies, are outside of the scope of CA-2

Control Enhancements:
|  (1) CONTROL ASSESSMENTS  INDEPENDENT ASSESSORSo
Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct control assessments. h
gDiscussion:  Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who
fconduct impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality means that assessors are free from r
any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation,
sustainment, or management of the systems under assessment or the determination of
control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting s
interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their d
iown work, act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place .
gthemselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.
Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or be 6
2contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials
Ndetermine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems
and/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing T
officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance
8that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. Assessor
independence determination includes whether contracted assessment services have
sufficient independence, such as when system owners are not directly involved in
contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of the assessors conducting the
assessments. During the system design and development phase, having independent
assessors is analogous to having independent SMEs involved in design reviews.
When organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the organizations
require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental,
operational, or management chain of the system owners, independence in assessment
processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and
analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity,
and reliability of the results. Assessments performed for purposes other than to support

Assignment: organization-defined frequencyInclude as part of control assessments, [],
Selection: announced; unannouncedSelection (one or more): in-depth monitoring; [], [
security instrumentation; automated security test cases; vulnerability scanning; malicious
user testing; insider threat assessment; performance and load testing;data leakage or
data loss assessment; Assignment: organization-defined other forms of assessment[]].
Discussion:  Organizations can conduct specialized assessments, including verification and
validation, system monitoring, insider threat assessments, malicious user testing, and other
forms of testing. These assessments can improve readiness by exercising organizational
capabilities and indicating current levels of performance as a means of focusing actions to is
improve security and privacy. Organizations conduct specialized assessments in accordance
with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and lic
guidelines. Authorizing officials approve the assessment methods in coordination with the t
norganizational risk executive function. Organizations can include vulnerabilities uncovered
during assessments into vulnerability remediation processes. Specialized assessments can
also be conducted early in the system development life cycle (e.g., during initial design, a
development, and unit testing).

Discussion:  Organizations may rely on control assessments of organizational systems by
other (external) organizations. Using such assessments and reusing existing assessment t
sevidence can decrease the time and resources required for assessments by limiting the
dindependent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The factors that
i.organizations consider in determining whether to accept assessment results from external o
organizations can vary. Such factors include the organization’s past experience with the
organization that conducted the assessment, the reputation of the assessment organization,
the level of detail of supporting assessment evidence provided, and mandates imposed by
applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. /
