Discussion:  Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy and procedures address the o
controls in the CA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk
/management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies 1
.and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that 6
2security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of assessment, authorization, and
Nmonitoring policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the
organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-
specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and
privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of 8
0organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or
3business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls
are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
documents. Events that may precipitate an update to assessment, authorization, and monitoring
policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or
changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.
Related Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.
Control Enhancements:  None.
