System information exchanges include connections via leased\nlines or virtual private networks, connections to internet service providers, database sharing or\nexchanges of database transaction information, connections and exchanges with cloud services,\nexchanges via web-based services, or exchanges of files via file transfer protocols, network\nprotocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6), email, or other organization-to-organization communications. T\niOrganizations consider the risk related to new or increased threats that may be introduced when s\nsystems exchange information with other systems that may have different security and privacy u\nlrequirements and controls. This includes systems within the same organization and systems that ic\nare external to the organization. A joint authorization of the systems exchanging information, as t\nCA-6(1) or CA-6(2), may help to communicate and reduce risk. described in\nAuthorizing officials determine the risk associated with system information exchange and the v\nicontrols needed for appropriate risk mitigation. The types of agreements selected are based on la\nlfactors such as the impact level of the information being exchanged, the relationship between e\nrthe organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to\nbusiness, business to business, government or business to service provider, government or\nbusiness to individual), or the level of access to the organizational system by users of the other c\nasystem. If systems that exchange information have the same authorizing official, organizations\neneed not develop agreements. Instead, the interface characteristics between the systems (e.g.,\nohow the information is being exchanged. how the information is protected) are described in the\n:respective security and privacy plans. If the systems that exchange information have different\nauthorizing officials within the same organization, the organizations can develop agreements or t\nprovide the same information that would be provided in the appropriate agreement type from :\nin the respective security and privacy plans for the systems. Organizations may incorporate CA-3ao\nagreement information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established\n/between federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (including service providers, contractors, 1\n.system developers, and system integrators). Risk considerations include systems that share the 6\n2same networks.\nIRelated Controls:  AC-4,  AC-20, AU-16, CA-6, IA-3, IR-4, PL-2,PT-7, RA-3, SA-9, SC-7, SI-12.\nSControl Enhancements:\n0|(1)  SYSTEM CONNECTIONS  UNCLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM CONNECTIONS\n.] [Withdrawn: Moved to SC-7(25)3\n| (2) SYSTEM CONNECTIONS  CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM CONNECTIONS\n[Withdrawn: Moved to SC-7(26).]\n|-(3)  SYSTEM CONNECTIONS  UNCLASSIFIED NONNATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM CONNECTIONS\n.] [Withdrawn: Moved to SC-7(27)\n|(4)  SYSTEM CONNECTIONS  CONNECTIONS TO PUBLIC NETWORKS\n.] [Withdrawn: Moved to SC-7(28)\n| (5) SYSTEM CONNECTIONS  RESTRICTIONS ON EXTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 87\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n[Withdrawn: Moved to SC-7(5).]\n| (6) INFORMATION EXCHANGE  TRANSFER AUTHORIZATIONS\nVerify that individuals or systems transferring data between interconnecting systems have\nthe requisite authorizations (i.e., write permissions or privileges) prior to accepting such\ndata.\nDiscussion:  To prevent unauthorized individuals and systems from making information\ntransfers to protected systems, the protected system verifies\u2014via independent means\u2014\nwhether the individual or system attempting to transfer information is authorized to do so.\nVerification of the authorization to transfer information also applies to control plane traffic\n(e.g., routing and DNS) and services (e.g., authenticated SMTP relays).\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-4.\n| (7) INFORMATION EXCHANGE TRANSITIVE INFORMATION EXCHANGES h\np(a)Identify transitive (downstream) information exchanges with other systems through\nCA-3a; and the systems identified in\n(b)Take measures to ensure that transitive (downstream) information exchanges cease  t\nwhen the controls on identified transitive (downstream) systems cannot be verified or\nvalidated.\nDiscussion:  Transitive or \u201cdownstream\u201d information exchanges are information exchanges i\nbbetween the system or systems with which the organizational system exchanges information\nand other systems. For mission-essential systems, services, and applications, including high f\nevalue assets, it is necessary to identify such information exchanges. The transparency of the\nfcontrols or protection measures in place in such downstream systems connected directly or\nindirectly to organizational systems is essential to understanding the security and privacy a\nrisks resulting from those information exchanges. Organizational systems can inherit risk\nfrom downstream systems through transitive connections and information exchanges, which r\ncan make the organizational systems more susceptible to threats, hazards, and adverse\nimpacts. t\nRelated Controls:  SC-7. :\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [FIPS 199], [SP 800-47]. i."
