Authorizing 0\nofficials provide budgetary oversight for organizational systems and common controls or assume 0\n8responsibility for the mission and business functions supported by those systems or common\ncontrols. The authorization process is a federal responsibility, and therefore, authorizing officials I\nmust be federal employees. Authorizing officials are both responsible and accountable for\nPsecurity and privacy risks associated with the operation and use of organizational systems.\nNonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize systems and senior officials 0\n-that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities. 5\nAuthorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on evidence produced from\nimplemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce\nthe need for separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive\ncontinuous monitoring processes, the information contained in authorization packages (i.e.,\nsecurity and privacy plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on\nan ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, common control providers, and system\nowners with an up-to-date status of the security and privacy posture of their systems, controls,\nand operating environments. To reduce the cost of reauthorization, authorizing officials can\nleverage the results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the\nbasis for rendering reauthorization decisions.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 89\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  CA-2, CA-3, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10, RA-3, SA-10, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:\n|\u2014- (1) AUTHORIZATION  JOINT AUTHORIZATION  INTRAORGANIZATION\nEmploy a joint authorization process for the system that includes multiple authorizing\nofficials from the same organization conducting the authorization.\nDiscussion:  Assigning multiple authorizing officials from the same organization to serve as\nco-authorizing officials for the system increases the level of independence in the risk-based\ndecision-making process. It also implements the concepts of separation of duties and dual\nauthorization as applied to the system authorization process. The intra-organization joint\nauthorization process is most relevant for connected systems, shared systems, and systems\nwith multiple information owners.\nRelated Controls:  AC-6.\n|\u2014- (2) AUTHORIZATION  JOINT AUTHORIZATION  INTERORGANIZATION u\nliEmploy a joint authorization process for the system that includes multiple authorizing c\nofficials with at least one authorizing official from an organization external to the i\norganization conducting the authorization.\nDiscussion:  Assigning multiple authorizing officials, at least one of whom comes from an v\niexternal organization, to serve as co-authorizing officials for the system increases the level of la\nindependence in the risk-based decision-making process. It implements the concepts of le\nseparation of duties and dual authorization as applied to the system authorization process. r\nEmploying authorizing officials from external organizations to supplement the authorizing\nofficial from the organization that owns or hosts the system may be necessary when the c\naexternal organizations have a vested interest or equities in the outcome of the authorization\nedecision. The inter-organization joint authorization process is relevant and appropriate for\nconnected systems, shared systems or services, and systems with multiple information o\nowners. The authorizing officials from the external organizations are key stakeholders of the :\ntsystem undergoing authorization. t\nRelated Controls:  AC-6. /\ni.References:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-137]. o"
