S\nDiscussion:  Internal system connections are connections between organizational systems and\n8separate constituent system components (i.e., connections between components that are part of\nthe same system) including components used for system development. Intra-system connections -\ninclude connections with mobile devices, notebook and desktop computers, tablets, printers,\ncopiers, facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each internal\nsystem connection individually, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of\nsystem components with common characteristics and/or configurations, including printers,\nscanners, and copiers with a specified processing, transmission, and storage capability or smart\nphones and tablets with a specific baseline configuration. The continued need for an internal\nsystem connection is reviewed from the perspective of whether it provides support for\norganizational missions or business functions.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, CM-2, IA-3, SC-7, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 94\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n|  (1) INTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS  COMPLIANCE CHECKS\nPerform security and privacy compliance checks on constituent system components prior\nto the establishment of the internal connection.\nDiscussion:  Compliance checks include verification of the relevant baseline configuration.\nRelated Controls:  CM-6.\nReferences:  [SP 800-124], [IR 8023].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 95"
