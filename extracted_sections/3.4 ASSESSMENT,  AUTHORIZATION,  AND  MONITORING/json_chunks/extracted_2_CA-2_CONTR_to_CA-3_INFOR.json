The required skills include\nhgeneral knowledge of risk management concepts and approaches as well as comprehensive\nknowledge of and experience with the hardware, software, and firmware system components s\n/implemented. d\nOrganizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those systems operate\n/as part of initial and ongoing authorizations, continuous monitoring, FISMA annual assessments, 1\n.system design and development, systems security engineering, privacy engineering, and the 6\n2system development life cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet information\nNsecurity and privacy requirements, identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the system design and\ndevelopment process, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part T\nof authorization processes, and comply with vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations\nconduct assessments on the implemented controls as documented in security and privacy plans. 8\nAssessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of\n3systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for controls can be\nassessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design reviews conducted. If a design\nto implement controls and subsequent implementation in accordance with the design are\nassessed during development, the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing\npreviously completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes.\nOrganizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment plan for the\nsystem or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment plan clearly delineates the roles\nand responsibilities for control assessment. If multiple organizations participate in assessing a\nsystem, a coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.\nOrganizations can use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and\nsystem monitoring, to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the system\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 84\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nlife cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail, as deemed\nnecessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and\nwhether the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the\ndesired outcome with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the\nindividuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example,\nassessments conducted in support of authorization decisions are provided to authorizing\nofficials, senior agency officials for privacy, senior agency information security officers, and\nauthorizing official designated representatives.\nTo satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the\nfollowing sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations, continuous monitoring, systems\nengineering processes, or system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that\nassessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control effectiveness, and\nobtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control assessment T\niresults can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented s\nwith additional assessments as needed. After the initial authorizations, organizations assess u\nlcontrols during continuous monitoring. Organizations also establish the frequency for ongoing ic\ntassessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. External audits,\n. including audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies, are outside of the scope of CA-2\nRelated Controls:  AC-20, CA-5, CA-6, CA-7, PM-9, RA-5, RA-10, SA-11, SC-38, SI-3, SI-12, SR-2, SR-v\nl3. a\nControl Enhancements:\n|  (1) CONTROL ASSESSMENTS  INDEPENDENT ASSESSORSo\nEmploy independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct control assessments. h\ngDiscussion:  Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who\nfconduct impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality means that assessors are free from r\nany perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation,\nsustainment, or management of the systems under assessment or the determination of\ncontrol effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting s\ninterest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their d\niown work, act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place .\ngthemselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.\nIndependent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or be 6\n2contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials\nNdetermine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems\nand/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing T\nofficials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance\n8that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. Assessor\nindependence determination includes whether contracted assessment services have\nsufficient independence, such as when system owners are not directly involved in\ncontracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of the assessors conducting the\nassessments. During the system design and development phase, having independent\nassessors is analogous to having independent SMEs involved in design reviews.\nWhen organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the organizations\nrequire that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental,\noperational, or management chain of the system owners, independence in assessment\nprocesses can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and\nanalyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity,\nand reliability of the results. Assessments performed for purposes other than to support\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 85\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nauthorization decisions are more likely to be useable for such decisionswhen performed by\nassessors with sufficient independence, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) CONTROL ASSESSMENTS  SPECIALIZED ASSESSMENTS\nAssignment: organization-defined frequencyInclude as part of control assessments, [],\nSelection: announced; unannouncedSelection (one or more): in-depth monitoring; [], [\nsecurity instrumentation; automated security test cases; vulnerability scanning; malicious\nuser testing; insider threat assessment; performance and load testing;data leakage or\ndata loss assessment; Assignment: organization-defined other forms of assessment[]].\nDiscussion:  Organizations can conduct specialized assessments, including verification and\nvalidation, system monitoring, insider threat assessments, malicious user testing, and other\nforms of testing. These assessments can improve readiness by exercising organizational\ncapabilities and indicating current levels of performance as a means of focusing actions to is\nimprove security and privacy. Organizations conduct specialized assessments in accordance\nwith applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and lic\nguidelines. Authorizing officials approve the assessment methods in coordination with the t\nnorganizational risk executive function. Organizations can include vulnerabilities uncovered\nduring assessments into vulnerability remediation processes. Specialized assessments can\nalso be conducted early in the system development life cycle (e.g., during initial design, a\ndevelopment, and unit testing).\nRelated Controls:  PE-3, SI-2. f\n| (3) CONTROL ASSESSMENTS  LEVERAGING RESULTS FROM EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONSo\nhAssignment: organization-Leverage the results of control assessments performed by [\ndefined external organizationAssignment: organization-defined system] on [] when the g\nAssignment: organization-defined requirementsassessment meets []. f\nDiscussion:  Organizations may rely on control assessments of organizational systems by\nother (external) organizations. Using such assessments and reusing existing assessment t\nsevidence can decrease the time and resources required for assessments by limiting the\ndindependent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The factors that\ni.organizations consider in determining whether to accept assessment results from external o\norganizations can vary. Such factors include the organization\u2019s past experience with the\norganization that conducted the assessment, the reputation of the assessment organization,\nthe level of detail of supporting assessment evidence provided, and mandates imposed by\napplicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. /\nSISO 15408-1], Accredited testing laboratories that support the Common Criteria Program [\n.the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), or the NIST Cryptographic S\nAlgorithm Validation Program (CAVP) can provide independent assessment results that .\norganizations can leverage. 0\n3Related Controls:  SA-4.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [FIPS 199], [SP 800-18], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-53A], [SP\n800-115], [SP 800-137], [IR 8011-1], [IR 8062]."
