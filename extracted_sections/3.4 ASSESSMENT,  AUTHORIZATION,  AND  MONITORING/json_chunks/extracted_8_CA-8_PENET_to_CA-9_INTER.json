Penetration testing can be used to validate\nvulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries\nwithin specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration\ntesting attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of\nsecurity- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially\nhimportant when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies\n(e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). p\nliOrganizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing c\ntactivities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, i\nsoftware, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical\ncontrols. A standard method for penetration testing includes a pretest analysis based on full a\nknowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest\nbanalysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All parties agree\nto the rules of engagement before commencing penetration testing scenarios. Organizations f\ncorrelate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques, and e\nprocedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries. Penetration testing may result in f\nthe exposure of information that is protected by laws or regulations, to individuals conducting\ngthe testing. Rules of engagement, contracts, or other appropriate mechanisms can be used to\nfcommunicate expectations for how to protect this information. Risk assessments guide the r\ndecisions on the level of independence required for the personnel conducting penetration\ntesting.\n:.

Red team exercises simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise\nmission and business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the security and\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 93\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nprivacy posture of systems and organizations. Such attempts may include technology-based\nattacks and social engineering-based attacks. Technology-based attacks include interactions\nwith hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission and business processes.\nSocial engineering-based attacks include interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing,\nor personal conversations. Red team exercises are most effective when conducted by\npenetration testing agents and teams with knowledge of and experience with current\nadversarial tactics, techniques, procedures, and tools. While penetration testing may be\nprimarily laboratory-based testing, organizations can use red team exercises to provide more\ncomprehensive assessments that reflect real-world conditions. The results from red team\nexercises can be used by organizations to improve security and privacy awareness and\ntraining and to assess control effectiveness.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|  (3) PENETRATION TESTING  FACILITY PENETRATION TESTINGh\nAssignment: organization-defined Employ a penetration testing process that includes [p\nbfrequencySelection: announced; unannounced] [] attempts to bypass or circumvent\nacontrols associated with physical access points to the facility.\nnDiscussion:  Penetration testing of physical access points can provide information on critical\nvulnerabilities in the operating environments of organizational systems. Such information\ncan be used to correct weaknesses or deficiencies in physical controls that are necessary to a\nprotect organizational systems.\nRelated Controls:  CA-2, PE-3. f\nReferences:  None. o"
