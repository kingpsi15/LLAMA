The\nterms \u201ccontinuous\u201d and \u201congoing\u201d imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls\nand risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may\nrequire different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring generate risk\nresponse actions by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that\nhave been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to determine the\nspecific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain\nthe authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation\nwith changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having\naccess to security and privacy information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards T\nigives organizational officials the ability to make effective and timely risk management decisions, s\nincluding ongoing authorization decisions. u\nAutomation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware inventories, a\noauthorization packages, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when\nicontinuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, s\nactionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with v\nlthe security categories of systems. Monitoring requirements, including the need for specific a\nlAC-monitoring, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements, such as AC-2g, e\nr2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-2(7)(b), AC-2(7)(c), AC-17(1), AT-4a, AU-13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-\n6d, CM-11c, IR-5, MA-2b, MA-3a, MA-4a, PE-3d, PE-6, PE-14b, PE-16, PE-20, PM-6, PM-23, PM-\n31, PS-7e, SA-9c, SR-4, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-43b, and SI-4. c\ngRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-6, AC-17, AT-4, AU-6, AU-13, CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4, CM-6,\nCM-11, IA-5, IR-5, MA-2, MA-3, MA-4, PE-3, PE-6, PE-14, PE-16, PE-20, PL-2, PM-4, PM-6, PM-9, f\nm PM-10, PM-12, PM-14, PM-23, PM-28, PM-31, PS-7,PT-7, RA-3, RA-5, RA-7, RA-10, SA-8, SA-9,\nh SA-11, SC-5, SC-7, SC-18, SC-38, SC-43, SI-3, SI-4, SI-12, SR-6.\nControl Enhancements: :\ni| (1). CONTINUOUS MONITORING  INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT\nEmploy independent assessors or assessment teams to monitor the controls in the system /\non an ongoing basis. .\n2Discussion:  Organizations maximize the value of control assessments by requiring that\nNassessments be conducted by assessors with appropriate levels of independence. The level\nof required independence is based on organizational continuous monitoring strategies. T\nAssessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to the monitoring process. To\n8achieve such impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the\norganizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as\nmanagement or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in\nadvocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their services.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) CONTINUOUS MONITORING  TYPES OF ASSESSMENTS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CA-2.]\n| (3) CONTINUOUS MONITORING  TREND ANALYSES\nEmploy trend analyses to determine if control implementations, the frequency of\ncontinuous monitoring activities, and the types of activities used in the continuous\nmonitoring process need to be modified based on empirical data.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 91\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  Trend analyses include examining recent threat information that addresses the\ntypes of threat events that have occurred in the organization or the Federal Government,\nsuccess rates of certain types of attacks, emerging vulnerabilities in technologies, evolving\nsocial engineering techniques, the effectiveness of configuration settings, results from\nmultiple control assessments, and findings from Inspectors General or auditors.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (4) CONTINUOUS MONITORING  RISK MONITORING\nEnsure risk monitoring is an integral part of the continuous monitoring strategy that\nincludes the following:\nEffectiveness monitoring; (a)\nCompliance monitoring; and (b)\nChange monitoring. (c) h\nDiscussion:  Risk monitoring is informed by the established organizational risk tolerance. p\nbEffectiveness monitoring determines the ongoing effectiveness of the implemented risk\nresponse measures. Compliance monitoring verifies that required risk response measures a\nare implemented. It also verifies that security and privacy requirements are satisfied. Change\nismonitoring identifies changes to organizational systems and environments of operation that\nvmay affect security and privacy risk.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nf| (5) rCONTINUOUS MONITORING  CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS\nEmploy the following actions to validate that policies are established and implemented o\ncAssignment: organization-defined actionscontrols are operating in a consistent manner: [].\nDiscussion:  Security and privacy controls are often added incrementally to a system. As a g\nresult, policies for selecting and implementing controls may be inconsistent, and the controls f\nmcould fail to work together in a consistent or coordinated manner. At a minimum, the lack of\nhconsistency and coordination could mean that there are unacceptable security and privacy\ngaps in the system. At worst, it could mean that some of the controls implemented in one\n/location or by one component are actually impeding the functionality of other controls (e.g.,\nencrypting internal network traffic can impede monitoring). In other situations, failing to i.\nconsistently monitor all implemented network protocols (e.g., a dual stack of IPv4 and IPv6) g\nmay create unintended vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by adversaries. 0\nIt is important to validate\u2014through testing, monitoring, and analysis\u2014that the implemented 0\n8controls are operating in a consistent, coordinated, non-interfering manner.\nRelated Controls:  None.
