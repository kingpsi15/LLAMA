The risk\n/management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies 1\n.and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that 6\n2security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of assessment, authorization, and\nNmonitoring policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the\norganization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-\nspecific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and\nprivacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of 8\n0organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or\n3business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls\nare implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.\nProcedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate\ndocuments. Events that may precipitate an update to assessment, authorization, and monitoring\npolicy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or\nchanges in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and\nguidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 83\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-53A], [SP\n800-100], [SP 800-137], [SP 800-137A], [IR 8062]."
