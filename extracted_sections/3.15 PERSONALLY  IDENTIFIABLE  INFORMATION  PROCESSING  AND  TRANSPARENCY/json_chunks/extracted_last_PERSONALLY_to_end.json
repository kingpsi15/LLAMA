The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies N\nand procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore,\nSit is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of personally\n.identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures. Security and privacy 8\n0program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may\nobviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be 3\nincluded as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies\nthat reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and\nprivacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures\ndescribe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or\nrole that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and\nprivacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to\npersonally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures include\nassessment or audit findings, breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not\nconstitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 229\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  None.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130].\nPT-2 AUTHORITY TO PROCESS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION\nControl:\nAssignment:organization-defined authoritya.Determine and document the [ ] that permits the\nAssignment:organization-defined processing[ ] of personally identifiable information; and\nAssignment:organization-defined processingb.Restrict the [ ] of personally identifiable\ninformation to only that which is authorized.\nhDiscussion:  The processing of personally identifiable information is an operation or set of\noperations that the information system or organization performs with respect to personally p\nbidentifiable information across the information life cycle. Processing includes but is not limited to\ncreation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and a\ndisposal. Processing operations also include logging, generation, and transformation, as well as\nianalysis techniques, such as data mining.  s\naOrganizations may be subject to laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that\nestablish the organization\u2019s authority and thereby limit certain types of processing of personally b\nidentifiable information or establish other requirements related to the processing. Organizational\npersonnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such e\nauthority, particularly if the organization is subject to multiple jurisdictions or sources of f\nhauthority. For organizations whose processing is not determined according to legal authorities,\ngthe organization\u2019s policies and determinations govern how they process personally identifiable\nfinformation. While processing of personally identifiable information may be legally permissible,\nprivacy risks may still arise. Privacy risk assessments can identify the privacy risks associated with\nhthe authorized processing of personally identifiable information and support solutions to manage\nsuch risks.  s\noOrganizations consider applicable requirements and organizational policies to determine how to\ndocument this authority. For federal agencies, the authority to process personally identifiable\ninformation is documented in privacy policies and notices, system of records notices, privacy 1\n.] statements, computer matching agreements and notices, impact assessments, [PRIVACT6\n2contracts, information sharing agreements, memoranda of understanding, and other\nNdocumentation.\nOrganizations take steps to ensure that personally identifiable information is only processed for .\nauthorized purposes, including training organizational personnel on the authorized processing of\n0personally identifiable information and monitoring and auditing organizational use of personally\n5identifiable information.\nSI-Related Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, CM-13, IR-9, PM-9, PM-24, PT-1, PT-3, PT-5, PT-6, RA-3, RA-8,\n12, SI-18.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) AUTHORITY TO PROCESS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION  DATA TAGGING\nAssignment:organization-defined authorized processingAttach data tags containing [ ] to\nAssignment: organization-defined elements of personally identifiable information[].\nDiscussion:  Data tags support the tracking and enforcement of authorized processing by\nconveying the types of processing that are authorized along with the relevant elements of\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 230\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\npersonally identifiable information throughout the system.

Consent may be required by\n/applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines.\nOtherwise, when selecting consent as a control, organizations consider whether individuals can\nrbe reasonably expected to understand and accept the privacy risks that arise from their\nauthorization. Organizations consider whether other controls may more effectively mitigate\n6privacy risk either alone or in conjunction with consent. Organizations also consider any\ndemographic or contextual factors that may influence the understanding or behavior of 8\nindividuals with respect to the processing carried out by the system or organization. When\nTsoliciting consent from individuals, organizations consider the appropriate mechanism for\nobtaining consent, including the type of consent (e.g., opt-in, opt-out), how to properly P\nauthenticate and identity proof individuals and how to obtain consent through electronic means.\nIn addition, organizations consider providing a mechanism for individuals to revoke consent once -\nit has been provided, as appropriate.
