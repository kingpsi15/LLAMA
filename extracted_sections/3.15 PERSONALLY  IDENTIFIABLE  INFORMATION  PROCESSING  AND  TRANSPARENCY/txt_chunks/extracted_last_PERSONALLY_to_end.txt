.Discussion:  Personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and
procedures address the controls in the PT family that are implemented within systems and 2
/organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies N
and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore,
Sit is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of personally
.identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures. Security and privacy 8
0program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may
obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be 3
included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies
that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and
privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to
personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures include
assessment or audit findings, breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders,
directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not
constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

PT-2 AUTHORITY TO PROCESS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Control:
Assignment:organization-defined authoritya.Determine and document the [ ] that permits the
Assignment:organization-defined processing[ ] of personally identifiable information; and
Assignment:organization-defined processingb.Restrict the [ ] of personally identifiable
information to only that which is authorized.
hDiscussion:  The processing of personally identifiable information is an operation or set of
operations that the information system or organization performs with respect to personally p
bidentifiable information across the information life cycle. Processing includes but is not limited to
creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and a
disposal. Processing operations also include logging, generation, and transformation, as well as
ianalysis techniques, such as data mining.  s
aOrganizations may be subject to laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that
establish the organization’s authority and thereby limit certain types of processing of personally b
identifiable information or establish other requirements related to the processing. Organizational
personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such e
authority, particularly if the organization is subject to multiple jurisdictions or sources of f
hauthority. For organizations whose processing is not determined according to legal authorities,
gthe organization’s policies and determinations govern how they process personally identifiable
finformation. While processing of personally identifiable information may be legally permissible,
privacy risks may still arise. Privacy risk assessments can identify the privacy risks associated with
hthe authorized processing of personally identifiable information and support solutions to manage
such risks.  s
oOrganizations consider applicable requirements and organizational policies to determine how to
document this authority. For federal agencies, the authority to process personally identifiable
information is documented in privacy policies and notices, system of records notices, privacy 1
.] statements, computer matching agreements and notices, impact assessments, [PRIVACT6
2contracts, information sharing agreements, memoranda of understanding, and other
Ndocumentation.
Organizations take steps to ensure that personally identifiable information is only processed for .
authorized purposes, including training organizational personnel on the authorized processing of
0personally identifiable information and monitoring and auditing organizational use of personally
5identifiable information.

personally identifiable information; n

ed.Monitor changes in processing personally identifiable information and implement
Assignment: organization-defined mechanisms[] to ensure that any changes are made in f
Assignment: organization-defined requirementsaccordance with [].
Discussion:  Identifying and documenting the purpose for processing provides organizations with
oa basis for understanding why personally identifiable information may be processed. The term  m
:“process” includes every step of the information life cycle, including creation, collection, use,
tprocessing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal. Identifying and p
:documenting the purpose of processing is a prerequisite to enabling owners and operators of the /
osystem and individuals whose information is processed by the system to understand how the
information will be processed. This enables individuals to make informed decisions about their r
1engagement with information systems and organizations and to manage their privacy interests.
6Once the specific processing purpose has been identified, the purpose is described in the
organization’s privacy notices, policies, and any related privacy compliance documentation,
PRIVACT] statements, including privacy impact assessments, system of records notices, [
computer matching notices, and other applicable Federal Register notices. T
Organizations take steps to help ensure that personally identifiable information is processed only
for identified purposes, including training organizational personnel and monitoring and auditing
5organizational processing of personally identifiable information.
Organizations monitor for changes in personally identifiable information processing.
Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel to
ensure that any new purposes that arise from changes in processing are compatible with the
purpose for which the information was collected, or if the new purpose is not compatible,
implement mechanisms in accordance with defined requirements to allow for the new
processing, if appropriate. Mechanisms may include obtaining consent from individuals, revising
privacy policies, or other measures to manage privacy risks that arise from changes in personally
identifiable information processing purposes.

Discussion:  Consent allows individuals to participate in making decisions about the processing of  m
their information and transfers some of the risk that arises from the processing of personally
pidentifiable information from the organization to an individual. Consent may be required by
/applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines.
Otherwise, when selecting consent as a control, organizations consider whether individuals can
rbe reasonably expected to understand and accept the privacy risks that arise from their
authorization. Organizations consider whether other controls may more effectively mitigate
6privacy risk either alone or in conjunction with consent. Organizations also consider any
demographic or contextual factors that may influence the understanding or behavior of 8
individuals with respect to the processing carried out by the system or organization. When
Tsoliciting consent from individuals, organizations consider the appropriate mechanism for
obtaining consent, including the type of consent (e.g., opt-in, opt-out), how to properly P
authenticate and identity proof individuals and how to obtain consent through electronic means.
In addition, organizations consider providing a mechanism for individuals to revoke consent once -
it has been provided, as appropriate. Finally, organizations consider usability factors to help r
individuals understand the risks being accepted when providing consent, including the use of
plain language and avoiding technical jargon.

product or service, other processing may not. In these circumstances, organizations allow
individuals to select how specific personally identifiable information elements may be

matching program either pertains to federal benefit programs or federal personnel or payroll
