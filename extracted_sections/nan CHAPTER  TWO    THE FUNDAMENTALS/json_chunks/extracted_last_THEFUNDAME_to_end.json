For federal\nisrequirementinformation security and privacy policies, the term  is generally used to refer to\nOMB A-information security and privacy obligations imposed on organizations. For example, [\n130] imposes information security and privacy requirements with which federal agencies must\nrequirementcomply when managing information resources. The term  can also be used in a\nbroader sense to refer to an expression of stakeholder protection needs for a particular system e\nor organization. Stakeholder protection needs and the corresponding security and privacy f\nrequirements may be derived from many sources (e.g., laws, executive orders, directives, a\nregulations, policies, standards, mission and business needs, or risk assessments). The term e\nrequirement, as used in this guideline, includes both legal and policy requirements, as well as an o\n:expression of the broader set of stakeholder protection needs that may be derived from other\ntsources. All of these requirements, when applied to a system, help determine the necessary p\n:24/ characteristics of the system\u2014encompassing security, privacy, and assurance.\nrOrganizations may divide security and privacy requirements into more granular categories, g\ndepending on where the requirements are employed in the system development life cycle 0\ncapability requirement0(SDLC) and for what purpose. Organizations may use the term  to describe\na capability that the system or organization must provide to satisfy a stakeholder protection /\nSneed. In addition, organizations may refer to system requirements that pertain to particular\nspecification requirementshardware, software, and firmware components of a system as \u2014that S\n.is, capabilities that implement all or part of a control and that may be assessed (i.e., as part of 8\nthe verification, validation, testing, and evaluation processes). Finally, organizations may use the\nstatement of work requirementsterm  to refer to actions that must be performed operationally\nor during system development.\n24 The system characteristics that impact security and privacy vary and include the system type and function in terms\nof its primary purpose; the system make-up in terms of its technology, mechanical, physical, and human elements;\nthe modes and states within which the system delivers its functions and services; the criticality or importance of the\nsystem and its constituent functions and services; the sensitivity of the data or information processed, stored, or\ntransmitted; the consequence of loss, failure, or degradation relative to the ability of the system to execute correctly\n]. and to provide for its own protection (i.e., self-protection); and monetary or other value [SP 800-160-1\nCHAPTER TWO  PAGE 7"
