For example,\nmaintaining the identity of individuals who request specific services across organizational p\nbboundaries may often be difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance and\naprivacy ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational audit logging simply\ncaptures the identity of individuals who issue requests at the initial system, and subsequent n\ni sOrganizations consider systems record that the requests originated from authorized individuals.\nvincluding processes for coordinating audit information requirements and protection of audit\nlinformation in information exchange agreements. a\nRelated Controls:  AU-3, AU-6, AU-7, CA-3, PT-7. f\nControl Enhancements: o\n-|  (1) CROSSORGANIZATIONAL AUDIT LOGGING  IDENTITY PRESERVATIONa\nePreserve the identity of individuals in cross-organizational audit trails.\nDiscussion:  Identity preservation is applied when there is a need to be able to trace actions  m\nthat are performed across organizational boundaries to a specific individual.\nRelated Controls:  IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8. s\n-|  o(2) CROSSORGANIZATIONAL AUDIT LOGGING  SHARING OF AUDIT INFORMATION\nrAssignment: organization-defined Provide cross-organizational audit information to [g\norganizationsAssignment: organization-defined cross-organizational sharing ] based on [0\nagreements]. 0\nDiscussion:  Due to the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization\nIsharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the auditing being S\nperformed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide sufficient .\ninformation to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information\n0resources by individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only individuals\u2019 home\n5organizations have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring\n5the sharing of audit information among organizations.\nRelated Controls:  IR-4, SI-4.\n-| (3) CROSSORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING  DISASSOCIABILITY\nAssignment: organization-defined measuresImplement [] to disassociate individuals from\naudit information transmitted across organizational boundaries.\nDiscussion:  Preserving identities in audit trails could have privacy ramifications, such as\nenabling the tracking and profiling of individuals, but may not be operationally necessary.\nThese risks could be further amplified when transmitting information across organizational\nboundaries. Implementing privacy-enhancing cryptographic techniques can disassociate\nindividuals from audit information and reduce privacy risk while maintaining accountability.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 81\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 82"
