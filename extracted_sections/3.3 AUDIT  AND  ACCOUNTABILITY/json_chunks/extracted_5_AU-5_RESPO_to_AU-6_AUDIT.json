Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit\nlogging process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the failure, the severity of\nthe failure, or a combination of such factors. When the audit logging process failure is related to\nstorage, the response is carried out for the audit log storage repository (i.e., the distinct system\ncomponent where the audit logs are stored), the system on which the audit logs reside, the total\naudit log storage capacity of the organization (i.e., all audit log storage repositories combined), or\nall three. Organizations may decide to take no additional actions after alerting designated roles\nor personnel.\n.

Because of the importance of\nensuring mission and business continuity, organizations may determine that the nature of\nthe audit logging failure is not so severe that it warrants a complete shutdown of the system\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 69\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nsupporting the core organizational mission and business functions.
