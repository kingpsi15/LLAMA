The audit record\nreduction capability includes modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to\nidentify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the\nsystem can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be an issue if the\ngranularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.\nSI-Related Controls:  AC-2, AU-2, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-12, AU-16, CM-5, IA-5, IR-4, PM-12,\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) AUDIT RECORD REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION  AUTOMATIC PROCESSING\nProvide and implement the capability to process, sort, and search audit records for events\nAssignment: organization-defined fields within of interest based on the following content: [\naudit records].\nbDiscussion:  Events of interest can be identified by the content of audit records, including\nsystem resources involved, information objects accessed, identities of individuals, event a\ntypes, event locations, event dates and times, Internet Protocol addresses involved, or event\nissuccess or failure.
