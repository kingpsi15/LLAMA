Allocating sufficient audit\nlalog storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the\nlepotential loss or reduction of audit logging capability.\neRelated Controls:  AU-2, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-9, AU-11, AU-12, AU-14, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n|(1)  AUDIT LOG STORAGE CAPACITY  TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE STORAGE e\noAssignment: organization-defined frequencyTransfer audit logs [] to a different system,\n:system component, or media other than the system or system component conducting the\nlogging. t\n/Discussion:  Audit log transfer, also known as off-loading, is a common process in systems\nwith limited audit log storage capacity and thus supports availability of the audit logs. The\nrinitial audit log storage is only used in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate\n1with the secondary or alternate system allocated to audit log storage, at which point the\n6AU-9(2) in audit logs are transferred. Transferring audit logs to alternate storage is similar to\nthat audit logs are transferred to a different entity. However, the purpose of selecting AU-8\n9(2) is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of audit records. Organizations can select\nTeither control enhancement to obtain the benefit of increased audit log storage capacity and\npreserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of audit records and logs.
