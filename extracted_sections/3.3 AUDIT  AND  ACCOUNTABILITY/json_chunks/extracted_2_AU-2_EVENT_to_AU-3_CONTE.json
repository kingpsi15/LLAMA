The types of events that require\nlogging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the a\naprivacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event\ntypes include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or b\nprivacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action\nchanges, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types e\nthat require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of f\nhthe controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are\ngoperational and supported by the system.\noTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging\n:requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For\ntexample, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access\n:successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due /\noto the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to\nbe logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help r\nensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization. 1\nOrganizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals 6\n2that may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the\nNpotential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging\nevent is based on patterns or time of usage. T\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in\n0, other controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1)\n5CM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8),\nSI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable 5\nlaws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records\ncan be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the\nnetwork. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring\nand auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types,\norganizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in\ndistributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented\narchitectures.\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-\n11, AU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-\n7, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 66\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) EVENT LOGGING  COMPILATION OF AUDIT RECORDS FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AU-12.]\n| (2) EVENT LOGGING  SELECTION OF AUDIT EVENTS BY COMPONENT\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AU-12.]\n| (3) EVENT LOGGING  REVIEWS AND UPDATES\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AU-2.]\n| (4) EVENT LOGGING  PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6(9).]\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-92].    h"
