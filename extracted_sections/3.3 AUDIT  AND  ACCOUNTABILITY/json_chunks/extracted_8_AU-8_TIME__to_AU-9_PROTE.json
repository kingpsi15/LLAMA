Time is commonly\n.expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time S\n(GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the .\ndegree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing 0\nwithin hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time\n5granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical to other security\ncapabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the\nnature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.\nRelated Controls:  AU-3, AU-12, AU-14, SC-45.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) TIME STAMPS  SYNCHRONIZATION WITH AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE\n[Withdrawn: Moved to SC-45(1).]\n| (2) TIME STAMPS  SECONDARY AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 73\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n[Withdrawn: Moved to SC-45(2).]\nReferences:  None."
