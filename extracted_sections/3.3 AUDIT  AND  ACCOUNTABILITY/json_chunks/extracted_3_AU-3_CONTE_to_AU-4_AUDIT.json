  "content": "AU-3 CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS b\nControl:  Ensure that audit records contain information that establishes the following: t i\nia.What type of event occurred;  s\nab.When the event occurred;\nc.Where the event occurred;  le\nd.Source of the event;\ne.Outcome of the event; and   c\nrf.Identity of any individuals, subjects, or objects/entities associated with the event.  g\nrDiscussion:  Audit record content that may be necessary to support the auditing function o\nincludes event descriptions (item a), time stamps (item b), source and destination addresses :\nt(item c), user or process identifiers (items d and f), success or fail indications (item e), and t\nfilenames involved (items a, c, e, and f) . Event outcomes include indicators of event success or :\nfailure and event-specific results, such as the system security and privacy posture after the event o\nooccurred. Organizations consider how audit records can reveal information about individuals that\n/may give rise to privacy risks and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the\npotential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the trail .\nrecords inputs or is based on patterns or time of usage. 2\nRelated Controls:  AU-2, AU-8, AU-12, AU-14, MA-4, PL-9, SA-8, SI-7, SI-11. I\nSControl Enhancements:\n| 0(1) CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS  ADDITIONAL AUDIT INFORMATION\nAssignment: Generate audit records containing the following additional information: [\n5organization-defined additional information].\nDiscussion:  The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on\nsystem functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider\nadditional information in audit records including, but not limited to, access control or flow\ncontrol rules invoked and individual identities of group account users. Organizations may\nalso consider limiting additional audit record information to only information that is\nexplicitly needed for audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs\nby not including information in audit records that could potentially be misleading, make it\nmore difficult to locate information of interest, or increase the risk to individuals' privacy.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 67\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n| (2) CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS  CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF PLANNED AUDIT RECORD CONTENT\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-9.]\n| (3) CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS  LIMIT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ELEMENTS\nLimit personally identifiable information contained in audit records to the following\nAssignment: organization-defined elements identified in the privacy risk assessment: [\nelements].\nDiscussion:  Limiting personally identifiable information in audit records when such\ninformation is not needed for operational purposes helps reduce the level of privacy risk\ncreated by a system.\nRelated Controls:  RA-3.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [IR 8062]."
