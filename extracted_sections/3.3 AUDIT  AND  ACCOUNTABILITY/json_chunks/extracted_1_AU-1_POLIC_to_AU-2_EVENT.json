The risk management strategy is an o\nimportant factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute\n/to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs 1\n.collaborate on the development of audit and accountability policy and procedures. Security and 6\n2privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and\nNmay obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be\nincluded as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies\nthat reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and\nprivacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures 8\ndescribe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or\n3role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and\nprivacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to\naudit and accountability policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security\nincidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,\npolicies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an\norganizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 65\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
