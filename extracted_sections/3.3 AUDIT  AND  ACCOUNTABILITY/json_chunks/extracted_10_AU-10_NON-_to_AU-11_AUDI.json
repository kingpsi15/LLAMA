  "content": "AU-10 NON-REPUDIATION\nControl:  Provide irrefutable evidence that an individual (or process acting on behalf of an\nAssignment: organization-defined actions to be covered by non-individual) has performed [\nrepudiation].\nDiscussion:  Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include creating information,\nsending and receiving messages, and approving information. Non-repudiation protects against\nclaims by authors of not having authored certain documents, senders of not having transmitted\nmessages, receivers of not having received messages, and signatories of not having signed\ndocuments. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an\nindividual or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract,\napproving a procurement request, or receiving specific information). Organizations obtain non-\nrepudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms, including digital signatures\nhand digital message receipts.\nuRelated Controls:  AU-9, PM-12, SA-8, SC-8, SC-12, SC-13, SC-16, SC-17, SC-23.\nControl Enhancements: a\n-| (1)  NONREPUDIATION  ASSOCIATION OF IDENTITIES\nAssignment: (a)Bind the identity of the information producer with the information to [ v\niorganization-defined strength of binding]; and la\nle(b)Provide the means for authorized individuals to determine the identity of the\nproducer of the information. e\nDiscussion:  Binding identities to the information supports audit requirements that provide\norganizational personnel with the means to identify who produced specific information in h\nthe event of an information transfer. Organizations determine and approve the strength of g\nattribute binding between the information producer and the information based on the f\nmsecurity category of the information and other relevant risk factors.\nRelated Controls:  AC-4, AC-16. t\n-|/ (2) NONREPUDIATION  VALIDATE BINDING OF INFORMATION PRODUCER IDENTITY/\ni(a)Validate the binding of the information producer identity to the information at  .\ngAssignment: organization-defined frequency[]; and\nAssignment: organization-defined actions(b)Perform [] in the event of a validation error.  .\n2Discussion:Validating the binding of the information producer identity to the information\nNprevents the modification of information between production and review.

If the reviewer is a human or if the review function is automated but\nseparate from the release or transfer function, the system associates the identity of the\nreviewer of the information to be released with the information and the information label.\nIn the case of human reviews, maintaining the credentials of reviewers or releasers provides\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 76\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nthe organization with the means to identify who reviewed and released the information.
