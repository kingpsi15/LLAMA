Audit logging tools are those programs and devices used to conduct system audit s\nand logging activities. Protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits u\nlthe ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. Physical protection ic\ntof audit information is addressed by both media protection controls and physical and i\nenvironmental protection controls.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-6, AU-6, AU-11, AU-14, AU-15, MP-2, MP-4, PE-2, PE-3, PE-6, SA-8, v\nlSC-8, SI-4. a\nControl Enhancements:\n|- (1) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  HARDWARE WRITEONCE MEDIAo\nWrite audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media. h\ngDiscussion:  Writing audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media applies to the initial\nfgeneration of audit trails (i.e., the collection of audit records that represents the information r\nto be used for detection, analysis, and reporting purposes) and to the backup of those audit\ntrails. Writing audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media does not apply to the\nsinitial generation of audit records prior to being written to an audit trail. Write-once, read-\ndmany (WORM) media includes Compact Disc-Recordable (CD-R), Blu-Ray Disc Recordable\ni.(BD-R), and Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable (DVD-R). In contrast, the use of switchable\nwrite-protection media, such as tape cartridges, Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, Compact\n0Disc Re-Writeable (CD-RW), and Digital Versatile Disc-Read Write (DVD-RW) results in write-\n0protected but not write-once media.\n/Related Controls:  AU-4, AU-5. N\n| (2) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  STORE ON SEPARATE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS OR COMPONENTS .\nAssignment: organization-defined frequencyStore audit records [] in a repository that is .\npart of a physically different system or system component than the system or component 0\nbeing audited. 3\nDiscussion:  Storing audit records in a repository separate from the audited system or system\ncomponent helps to ensure that a compromise of the system being audited does not also\nresult in a compromise of the audit records. Storing audit records on separate physical\nsystems or components also preserves the confidentiality and integrity of audit records and\nfacilitates the management of audit records as an organization-wide activity. Storing audit\nrecords on separate systems or components applies to initial generation as well as backup or\nlong-term storage of audit records.\nRelated Controls:  AU-4, AU-5.\n| (3) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 74\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nImplement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and\naudit tools.\nDiscussion:  Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit information\ninclude signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography. This enables the distribution\nof the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the\nsecret key used to generate the hash.\nRelated Controls:  AU-10, SC-12, SC-13.\n| (4) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  ACCESS BY SUBSET OF PRIVILEGED USERS\nAssignment: Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only [\norganization-defined subset of privileged users or roles].\nDiscussion:  Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the\nTsubject of an audit by that system may affect the reliability of the audit information by\niinhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. Requiring privileged access to be s\nufurther defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges limits the number of\nliusers or roles with audit-related privileges. c\niRelated Controls:  AC-5. o\n|  (5) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  DUAL AUTHORIZATION\nSelection (one or more): movement; deletionEnforce dual authorization for [] of i\nbAssignment: organization-defined audit information[].\nDiscussion:  Organizations may choose different selection options for different types of audit r\ninformation. Dual authorization mechanisms (also known as two-person control) require the\nTo reduce the risk of approval of two authorized individuals to execute audit functions.c\nacollusion, organizations consider rotating dual authorization duties to other individuals.\neOrganizations do not require dual authorization mechanisms when immediate responses are\nnecessary to ensure public and environmental safety. o\nRelated Controls:  AC-3.\ns|- (6) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  READONLY ACCESS\nAssignment: organization-defined oAuthorize read-only access to audit information to [\nsubset of privileged users or roles].\nDiscussion:  Restricting privileged user or role authorizations to read-only helps to limit the\npotential damage to organizations that could be initiated by such users or roles, such as\ndeleting audit records to cover up malicious activity. 8\nIRelated Controls:  None.\n|(7) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  STORE ON COMPONENT WITH DIFFERENT OPERATING\n8 SYSTEM\nStore audit information on a component running a different operating system than the 5\nsystem or component being audited. 5\nDiscussion:  Storing auditing information on a system component running a different\noperating system reduces the risk of a vulnerability specific to the system, resulting in a\ncompromise of the audit records.\nRelated controls:  AU-4, AU-5, AU-11, SC-29.\nReferences:  [FIPS 140-3], [FIPS 180-4], [FIPS 202].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 75\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
