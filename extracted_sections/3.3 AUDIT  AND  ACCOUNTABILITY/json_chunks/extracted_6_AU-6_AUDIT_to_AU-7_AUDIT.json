Findings can be\n0reported to organizational entities that include the incident response team, help desk, and\nsecurity or privacy offices. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit /\nIrecords or unable to conduct such activities, the review or analysis may be carried out by other S\n.organizations granted such authority. The frequency, scope, and/or depth of the audit record\nreview, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new\ninformation received.\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-6, AC-7, AC-17, AU-7, AU-16, CA-2, CA-7, CM-2, CM-5,\nCM-6, CM-10, CM-11, IA-2, IA-3, IA-5, IA-8, IR-5, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PE-6, RA-5, SA-8, SC-7, SI-3,\nSI-4, SI-7.\nControl Enhancements:\n,,| (1) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  AUTOMATED PROCESS INTEGRATION\nAssignment: Integrate audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes using [\norganization-defined automated mechanisms].\nDiscussion:  Organizational processes that benefit from integrated audit record review,\nanalysis, and reporting include incident response, continuous monitoring, contingency\nplanning, investigation and response to suspicious activities, and Inspector General audits.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 70\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  PM-7.\n,,|  (2) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  AUTOMATED SECURITY ALERTS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4.]\n,,|  (3) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  CORRELATE AUDIT RECORD REPOSITORIES\nAnalyze and correlate audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide\nsituational awareness.\nDiscussion:  Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all three\nlevels of risk management (i.e., organizational level, mission/business process level, and\ninformation system level) and supports cross-organization awareness.\nRelated Controls:  AU-12, IR-4.\nT,,|  (4) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  CENTRAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS\nProvide and implement the capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from p\nbmultiple components within the system.\nDiscussion:  Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include Security\nInformation and Event Management products. n\nRelated Controls:  AU-2, AU-12. a\nl,,| (5) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  INTEGRATED ANALYSIS OF AUDIT RECORDSa\nSelection (one or more): vulnerability Integrate analysis of audit records with analysis of [\nescanning information; performance data; system monitoring information;Assignment:  [\noorganization-defined data/information collected from other sources]] to further enhance\nthe ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity. h\ngDiscussion:  Integrated analysis of audit records does not require vulnerability scanning, the\nfgeneration of performance data, or system monitoring. Rather, integrated analysis requires r\nthat the analysis of information generated by scanning, monitoring, or other data collection\nactivities is integrated with the analysis of audit record information. Security Information\nand Event Management tools can facilitate audit record aggregation or consolidation from s\nmultiple system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of d\ni.standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script\ngadjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit\n0record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability\n0scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans of the\nsystem and in correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with /\nIperformance data can uncover denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that result S\nin the unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring information can .\nassist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information to operational situations.\n0Related Controls:  AU-12, IR-4.\nr,,|  (6) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  CORRELATION WITH PHYSICAL MONITORING5\nCorrelate information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring\nphysical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate,\nunusual, or malevolent activity.\nDiscussion:  The correlation of physical audit record information and the audit records from\nsystems may assist organizations in identifying suspicious behavior or supporting evidence of\nsuch behavior. For example, the correlation of an individual\u2019s identity for logical access to\ncertain systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was\npresent at the facility when the logical access occurred may be useful in investigations.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 71\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n,,|  (7) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  PERMITTED ACTIONS\nSelection (one or more): system process; role; userSpecify the permitted actions for each []\nassociated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit record information.\nDiscussion:  Organizations specify permitted actions for system processes, roles, and users\nassociated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit records through system account\nmanagement activities. Specifying permitted actions on audit record information is a way to\nenforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced by the system and\ninclude read, write, execute, append, and delete.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n,,|(8) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  FULL TEXT ANALYSIS OF PRIVILEGED\nCOMMANDS\nPerform a full text analysis of logged privileged commands in a physically distinct\ncomponent or subsystem of the system, or other system that is dedicated to that analysis.\nbDiscussion:  Full text analysis of privileged commands requires a distinct environment for the\nanalysis of audit record information related to privileged users without compromising such a\noinformation on the system where the users have elevated privileges, including the capability\nito execute privileged commands. Full text analysis refers to analysis that considers the full s\ntext of privileged commands (i.e., commands and parameters) as opposed to analysis that v\nlconsiders only the name of the command. Full text analysis includes the use of pattern a\nlmatching and heuristics. e\neRelated Controls:  AU-3, AU-9, AU-11, AU-12.\n,,| (9) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  CORRELATION WITH INFORMATION FROM c\na NONTECHNICAL SOURCES\nCorrelate information from nontechnical sources with audit record information to enhance\norganization-wide situational awareness.  m\nhDiscussion:  Nontechnical sources include records that document organizational policy\nviolations related to harassment incidents and the improper use of information assets. Such s\n/information can lead to a directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider d\niactivity. Organizations limit access to information that is available from nontechnical sources .\ngdue to its sensitive nature. Limited access minimizes the potential for inadvertent release of\nprivacy-related information to individuals who do not have a need to know. The correlation 0\nof information from nontechnical sources with audit record information generally occurs 0\n8only when individuals are suspected of being involved in an incident. Organizations obtain\nIlegal advice prior to initiating such actions.\n.Related Controls:  PM-12.
