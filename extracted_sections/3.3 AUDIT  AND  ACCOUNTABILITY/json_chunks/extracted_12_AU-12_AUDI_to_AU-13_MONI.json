The event\ntypes specified in AU-2d are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a\nsubset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.\nRelated Controls:  AC-6, AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-14, CM-5, MA-4, MP-4,\nPM-12, SA-8, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10.\niControl Enhancements: s\nb|-- (1) AUDIT RECORD GENERATION  SYSTEMWIDE AND TIMECORRELATED AUDIT TRAIL\nAssignment: organization-defined system componentsCompile audit records from [] into a\nnAssignment: system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within [\norganization-defined level of tolerance for the relationship between time stamps of\nindividual records in the audit trail ].a\nDiscussion:  Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records b\ncan be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering\nof the records within organizational tolerances. e\nRelated Controls:  AU-8, SC-45.\nr|  (2) AUDIT RECORD GENERATION  STANDARDIZED FORMATSg\nProduce a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit records in a r\nstandardized format.\ntDiscussion:  Audit records that follow common standards promote interoperability and t\ninformation exchange between devices and systems. Promoting interoperability and :\ninformation exchange facilitates the production of event information that can be readily o\noanalyzed and correlated. If logging mechanisms do not conform to standardized formats,\n/systems may convert individual audit records into standardized formats when compiling\n.system-wide audit trails.\nRelated Controls:  None. 8\n|S (3) AUDIT RECORD GENERATION  CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS\nSAssignment: organization-defined individuals or Provide and implement the capability for [\n.rolesAssignment: organization-defined system ] to change the logging to be performed on [8\n0componentsAssignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] based on [] within\n3Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds[].\nDiscussion:  Permitting authorized individuals to make changes to system logging enables\norganizations to extend or limit logging as necessary to meet organizational requirements.\nLogging that is limited to conserve system resources may be extended (either temporarily or\npermanently) to address certain threat situations. In addition, logging may be limited to a\nspecific set of event types to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations\ncan establish time thresholds in which logging actions are changed (e.g., near real-time,\nwithin minutes, or within hours).\nRelated Controls:  AC-3.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 78\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n|(4) AUDIT RECORD GENERATION  QUERY PARAMETER AUDITS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE\nINFORMATION\nProvide and implement the capability for auditing the parameters of user query events for\ndata sets containing personally identifiable information.\nDiscussion:  Query parameters are explicit criteria that an individual or automated system\nsubmits to a system to retrieve data. Auditing of query parameters for datasets that contain\npersonally identifiable information augments the capability of an organization to track and\nunderstand the access, usage, or sharing of personally identifiable information by authorized\npersonnel.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None."
