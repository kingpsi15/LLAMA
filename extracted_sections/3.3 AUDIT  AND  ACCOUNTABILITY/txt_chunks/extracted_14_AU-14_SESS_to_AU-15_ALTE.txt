Discussion:  Session audits can include monitoring keystrokes, tracking websites visited, and h
rrecording information and/or file transfers. Session audit capability is implemented in addition to
event logging and may involve implementation of specialized session capture technology.
Organizations consider how session auditing can reveal information about individuals that may m

pimpact system and network performance, organizations activate the capability under well-

consult with legal counsel, civil liberties officials, and privacy officials to ensure that any legal, i.
rprivacy, civil rights, or civil liberties issues, including the use of personally identifiable g
