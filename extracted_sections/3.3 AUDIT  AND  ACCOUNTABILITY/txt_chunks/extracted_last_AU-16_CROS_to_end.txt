AU-16 CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDIT LOGGING
Assignment: organization-defined methodsAssignment: Control:  Employ [] for coordinating [
organization-defined audit information] among external organizations when audit information is
transmitted across organizational boundaries.
Discussion:  When organizations use systems or services of external organizations, the audit
hlogging capability necessitates a coordinated, cross-organization approach. For example,
maintaining the identity of individuals who request specific services across organizational p
bboundaries may often be difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance and
aprivacy ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational audit logging simply
captures the identity of individuals who issue requests at the initial system, and subsequent n
i sOrganizations consider systems record that the requests originated from authorized individuals.

Discussion:  Identity preservation is applied when there is a need to be able to trace actions  m
that are performed across organizational boundaries to a specific individual.

Discussion:  Due to the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization
Isharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the auditing being S
performed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide sufficient .
information to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information

5organizations have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring

-| (3) CROSSORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING  DISASSOCIABILITY
Assignment: organization-defined measuresImplement [] to disassociate individuals from
audit information transmitted across organizational boundaries.
Discussion:  Preserving identities in audit trails could have privacy ramifications, such as
enabling the tracking and profiling of individuals, but may not be operationally necessary.
These risks could be further amplified when transmitting information across organizational
boundaries. Implementing privacy-enhancing cryptographic techniques can disassociate
individuals from audit information and reduce privacy risk while maintaining accountability.
