AU-9 PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION
Control:
a.Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification,
and deletion; and
Assignment: organization-defined personnel or rolesb.Alert [] upon detection of unauthorized
access, modification, or deletion of audit information.
Discussion:  Audit information includes all information needed to successfully audit system
activity, such as audit records, audit log settings, audit reports, and personally identifiable T
iinformation. Audit logging tools are those programs and devices used to conduct system audit s
and logging activities. Protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits u
lthe ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. Physical protection ic
tof audit information is addressed by both media protection controls and physical and i
environmental protection controls.

Control Enhancements:
|- (1) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  HARDWARE WRITEONCE MEDIAo
Write audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media. h
gDiscussion:  Writing audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media applies to the initial
fgeneration of audit trails (i.e., the collection of audit records that represents the information r
to be used for detection, analysis, and reporting purposes) and to the backup of those audit
trails. Writing audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media does not apply to the
sinitial generation of audit records prior to being written to an audit trail. Write-once, read-
dmany (WORM) media includes Compact Disc-Recordable (CD-R), Blu-Ray Disc Recordable
i.(BD-R), and Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable (DVD-R). In contrast, the use of switchable
write-protection media, such as tape cartridges, Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, Compact
0Disc Re-Writeable (CD-RW), and Digital Versatile Disc-Read Write (DVD-RW) results in write-
0protected but not write-once media.

| (2) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  STORE ON SEPARATE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS OR COMPONENTS .
Assignment: organization-defined frequencyStore audit records [] in a repository that is .
part of a physically different system or system component than the system or component 0
being audited. 3
Discussion:  Storing audit records in a repository separate from the audited system or system
component helps to ensure that a compromise of the system being audited does not also
result in a compromise of the audit records. Storing audit records on separate physical
systems or components also preserves the confidentiality and integrity of audit records and
facilitates the management of audit records as an organization-wide activity. Storing audit
records on separate systems or components applies to initial generation as well as backup or
long-term storage of audit records.

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and
audit tools.
Discussion:  Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit information
include signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography. This enables the distribution
of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the
secret key used to generate the hash.

| (4) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  ACCESS BY SUBSET OF PRIVILEGED USERS
Assignment: Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only [
organization-defined subset of privileged users or roles].
Discussion:  Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the
Tsubject of an audit by that system may affect the reliability of the audit information by
iinhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. Requiring privileged access to be s
ufurther defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges limits the number of
liusers or roles with audit-related privileges. c
iRelated Controls:  AC-5. o

bAssignment: organization-defined audit information[].
Discussion:  Organizations may choose different selection options for different types of audit r
information. Dual authorization mechanisms (also known as two-person control) require the
To reduce the risk of approval of two authorized individuals to execute audit functions.c
acollusion, organizations consider rotating dual authorization duties to other individuals.
eOrganizations do not require dual authorization mechanisms when immediate responses are
necessary to ensure public and environmental safety. o
Related Controls:  AC-3.
s|- (6) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  READONLY ACCESS
Assignment: organization-defined oAuthorize read-only access to audit information to [
subset of privileged users or roles].
Discussion:  Restricting privileged user or role authorizations to read-only helps to limit the
potential damage to organizations that could be initiated by such users or roles, such as
deleting audit records to cover up malicious activity. 8
IRelated Controls:  None.
|(7) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION  STORE ON COMPONENT WITH DIFFERENT OPERATING
8 SYSTEM
Store audit information on a component running a different operating system than the 5
system or component being audited. 5
Discussion:  Storing auditing information on a system component running a different
operating system reduces the risk of a vulnerability specific to the system, resulting in a
compromise of the audit records.
