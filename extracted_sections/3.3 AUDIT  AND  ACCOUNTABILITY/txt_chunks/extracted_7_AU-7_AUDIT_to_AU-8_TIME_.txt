AU-7 AUDIT RECORD REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION
Control:  Provide and implement an audit record reduction and report generation capability that:
a.Supports on-demand audit record review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-
the-fact investigations of incidents; and
b.Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.
Discussion:  Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit log information
and organizes it into a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record

reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same system or
from the same organizational entities that conduct audit logging activities. The audit record
reduction capability includes modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to
identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the
system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be an issue if the
granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.
