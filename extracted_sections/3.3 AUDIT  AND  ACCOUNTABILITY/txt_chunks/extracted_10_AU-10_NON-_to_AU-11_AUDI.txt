AU-10 NON-REPUDIATION
Control:  Provide irrefutable evidence that an individual (or process acting on behalf of an
Assignment: organization-defined actions to be covered by non-individual) has performed [
repudiation].
Discussion:  Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include creating information,
sending and receiving messages, and approving information. Non-repudiation protects against
claims by authors of not having authored certain documents, senders of not having transmitted
messages, receivers of not having received messages, and signatories of not having signed
documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an
individual or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract,
approving a procurement request, or receiving specific information). Organizations obtain non-
repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms, including digital signatures
hand digital message receipts.

Assignment: (a)Bind the identity of the information producer with the information to [ v
iorganization-defined strength of binding]; and la
le(b)Provide the means for authorized individuals to determine the identity of the
producer of the information. e
Discussion:  Binding identities to the information supports audit requirements that provide
organizational personnel with the means to identify who produced specific information in h
the event of an information transfer. Organizations determine and approve the strength of g
attribute binding between the information producer and the information based on the f
msecurity category of the information and other relevant risk factors.

2Discussion:Validating the binding of the information producer identity to the information
Nprevents the modification of information between production and review. The validation of
bindings can be achieved by, for example, using cryptographic checksums. Organizations
determine if validations are in response to user requests or generated automatically.

-| (3) NONREPUDIATION  CHAIN OF CUSTODY 3
Maintain reviewer or releaser credentials within the established chain of custody for
information reviewed or released.
Discussion:  Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence through its
collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting each individual who handled
the evidence, the date and time the evidence was collected or transferred, and the purpose
for the transfer. If the reviewer is a human or if the review function is automated but
separate from the release or transfer function, the system associates the identity of the
reviewer of the information to be released with the information and the information label.
In the case of human reviews, maintaining the credentials of reviewers or releasers provides

(a)Validate the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at the
Assignment: transfer or release points prior to release or transfer between [
organization-defined security domains]; and
Assignment: organization-defined actions(b)Perform [] in the event of a validation error.
Discussion:  Validating the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at
transfer or release points prevents the unauthorized modification of information between
review and the transfer or release. The validation of bindings can be achieved by using
Tcryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to user
irequests or generated automatically. s
