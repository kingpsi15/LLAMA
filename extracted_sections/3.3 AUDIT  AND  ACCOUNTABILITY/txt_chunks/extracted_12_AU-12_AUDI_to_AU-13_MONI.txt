a.Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of
Assignment: organization-defined system components on []; auditing as defined in AU-2a
Assignment: organization-defined personnel or rolesb.Allow [] to select the event types that
are to be logged by specific components of the system; and
that include the audit record c.Generate audit records for the event types defined in AU-2c
content defined in AU-3.
Discussion:  Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The event
types specified in AU-2d are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a
subset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.

b|-- (1) AUDIT RECORD GENERATION  SYSTEMWIDE AND TIMECORRELATED AUDIT TRAIL
Assignment: organization-defined system componentsCompile audit records from [] into a
nAssignment: system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within [
organization-defined level of tolerance for the relationship between time stamps of
individual records in the audit trail ].a
Discussion:  Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records b
can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering
of the records within organizational tolerances. e
Related Controls:  AU-8, SC-45.
r|  (2) AUDIT RECORD GENERATION  STANDARDIZED FORMATSg
Produce a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit records in a r
standardized format.
tDiscussion:  Audit records that follow common standards promote interoperability and t
information exchange between devices and systems. Promoting interoperability and :
information exchange facilitates the production of event information that can be readily o
oanalyzed and correlated. If logging mechanisms do not conform to standardized formats,
/systems may convert individual audit records into standardized formats when compiling
.system-wide audit trails.

|S (3) AUDIT RECORD GENERATION  CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS
SAssignment: organization-defined individuals or Provide and implement the capability for [
.rolesAssignment: organization-defined system ] to change the logging to be performed on [8
0componentsAssignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] based on [] within
3Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds[].
Discussion:  Permitting authorized individuals to make changes to system logging enables
organizations to extend or limit logging as necessary to meet organizational requirements.
Logging that is limited to conserve system resources may be extended (either temporarily or
permanently) to address certain threat situations. In addition, logging may be limited to a
specific set of event types to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations
can establish time thresholds in which logging actions are changed (e.g., near real-time,
within minutes, or within hours).

|(4) AUDIT RECORD GENERATION  QUERY PARAMETER AUDITS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
INFORMATION
Provide and implement the capability for auditing the parameters of user query events for
data sets containing personally identifiable information.
Discussion:  Query parameters are explicit criteria that an individual or automated system
submits to a system to retrieve data. Auditing of query parameters for datasets that contain
personally identifiable information augments the capability of an organization to track and
understand the access, usage, or sharing of personally identifiable information by authorized
personnel.
