pAU-4 AUDIT LOG STORAGE CAPACITY
liAssignment: organization-defined cControl:  Allocate audit log storage capacity to accommodate [
iaudit log retention requirements]. o
Discussion:  Organizations consider the types of audit logging to be performed and the audit log
processing requirements when allocating audit log storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit
lalog storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the
lepotential loss or reduction of audit logging capability.

/Discussion:  Audit log transfer, also known as off-loading, is a common process in systems
with limited audit log storage capacity and thus supports availability of the audit logs. The
rinitial audit log storage is only used in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate
1with the secondary or alternate system allocated to audit log storage, at which point the
6AU-9(2) in audit logs are transferred. Transferring audit logs to alternate storage is similar to
that audit logs are transferred to a different entity. However, the purpose of selecting AU-8
9(2) is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of audit records. Organizations can select
Teither control enhancement to obtain the benefit of increased audit log storage capacity and
preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of audit records and logs. P
