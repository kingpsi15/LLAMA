AU-3 CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS b
Control:  Ensure that audit records contain information that establishes the following: t i
ia.What type of event occurred;  s
ab.When the event occurred;
c.Where the event occurred;  le
d.Source of the event;
e.Outcome of the event; and   c
rf.Identity of any individuals, subjects, or objects/entities associated with the event.  g
rDiscussion:  Audit record content that may be necessary to support the auditing function o
includes event descriptions (item a), time stamps (item b), source and destination addresses :
t(item c), user or process identifiers (items d and f), success or fail indications (item e), and t
filenames involved (items a, c, e, and f) . Event outcomes include indicators of event success or :
failure and event-specific results, such as the system security and privacy posture after the event o
ooccurred. Organizations consider how audit records can reveal information about individuals that
/may give rise to privacy risks and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the
potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the trail .
records inputs or is based on patterns or time of usage. 2

Assignment: Generate audit records containing the following additional information: [
5organization-defined additional information].
Discussion:  The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on
system functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider
additional information in audit records including, but not limited to, access control or flow
control rules invoked and individual identities of group account users. Organizations may
also consider limiting additional audit record information to only information that is
explicitly needed for audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs
by not including information in audit records that could potentially be misleading, make it
more difficult to locate information of interest, or increase the risk to individuals' privacy.
Related Controls:  None.

Limit personally identifiable information contained in audit records to the following

elements].
Discussion:  Limiting personally identifiable information in audit records when such
information is not needed for operational purposes helps reduce the level of privacy risk
created by a system.
