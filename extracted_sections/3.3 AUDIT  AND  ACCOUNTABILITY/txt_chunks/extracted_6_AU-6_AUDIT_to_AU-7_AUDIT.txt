c.Adjust the level of audit record review, analysis, and reporting within the system when there  r

Discussion:  Audit record review, analysis, and reporting covers information security- and privacy-
srelated logging performed by organizations, including logging that results from the monitoring of
daccount usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration
i.settings, system component inventory, use of maintenance tools and non-local maintenance,
physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications at
0system interfaces, and use of mobile code or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Findings can be
0reported to organizational entities that include the incident response team, help desk, and
security or privacy offices. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit /
Irecords or unable to conduct such activities, the review or analysis may be carried out by other S
.organizations granted such authority. The frequency, scope, and/or depth of the audit record
review, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new
information received.

Analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide
situational awareness.
Discussion:  Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all three
levels of risk management (i.e., organizational level, mission/business process level, and
information system level) and supports cross-organization awareness.
Related Controls:  AU-12, IR-4.
T,,|  (4) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  CENTRAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS
Provide and implement the capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from p
bmultiple components within the system.
Discussion:  Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include Security
Information and Event Management products. n

l,,| (5) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  INTEGRATED ANALYSIS OF AUDIT RECORDSa
Selection (one or more): vulnerability Integrate analysis of audit records with analysis of [
escanning information; performance data; system monitoring information;Assignment:  [
oorganization-defined data/information collected from other sources]] to further enhance
the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity. h
gDiscussion:  Integrated analysis of audit records does not require vulnerability scanning, the
fgeneration of performance data, or system monitoring. Rather, integrated analysis requires r
that the analysis of information generated by scanning, monitoring, or other data collection
activities is integrated with the analysis of audit record information. Security Information
and Event Management tools can facilitate audit record aggregation or consolidation from s
multiple system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of d
i.standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script
gadjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit
0record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability
0scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans of the
system and in correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with /
Iperformance data can uncover denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that result S
in the unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring information can .
assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information to operational situations.

r,,|  (6) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  CORRELATION WITH PHYSICAL MONITORING5
Correlate information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring
physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate,
unusual, or malevolent activity.
Discussion:  The correlation of physical audit record information and the audit records from
systems may assist organizations in identifying suspicious behavior or supporting evidence of
such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individualâ€™s identity for logical access to
certain systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was
present at the facility when the logical access occurred may be useful in investigations.

Selection (one or more): system process; role; userSpecify the permitted actions for each []
associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit record information.
Discussion:  Organizations specify permitted actions for system processes, roles, and users
associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit records through system account
management activities. Specifying permitted actions on audit record information is a way to
enforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced by the system and
include read, write, execute, append, and delete.
Related Controls:  None.
,,|(8) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  FULL TEXT ANALYSIS OF PRIVILEGED
COMMANDS
Perform a full text analysis of logged privileged commands in a physically distinct
component or subsystem of the system, or other system that is dedicated to that analysis.
bDiscussion:  Full text analysis of privileged commands requires a distinct environment for the
analysis of audit record information related to privileged users without compromising such a
oinformation on the system where the users have elevated privileges, including the capability
ito execute privileged commands. Full text analysis refers to analysis that considers the full s
text of privileged commands (i.e., commands and parameters) as opposed to analysis that v
lconsiders only the name of the command. Full text analysis includes the use of pattern a
lmatching and heuristics. e

,,| (9) AUDIT RECORD REVIEW ANALYSIS AND REPORTING  CORRELATION WITH INFORMATION FROM c
a NONTECHNICAL SOURCES
Correlate information from nontechnical sources with audit record information to enhance
organization-wide situational awareness.  m
hDiscussion:  Nontechnical sources include records that document organizational policy
violations related to harassment incidents and the improper use of information assets. Such s
/information can lead to a directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider d
iactivity. Organizations limit access to information that is available from nontechnical sources .
gdue to its sensitive nature. Limited access minimizes the potential for inadvertent release of
privacy-related information to individuals who do not have a need to know. The correlation 0
of information from nontechnical sources with audit record information generally occurs 0
8only when individuals are suspected of being involved in an incident. Organizations obtain
Ilegal advice prior to initiating such actions.
