AU-5 RESPONSE TO AUDIT LOGGING PROCESS FAILURES
Control:
Assignment: organization-defined personnel or rolesAssignment: a.Alert [] within [
organization-defined time period] in the event of an audit logging process failure; and
Assignment: organization-defined additional actionsb.Take the following additional actions: [].
Discussion:  Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors, failures in audit
log capturing mechanisms, and reaching or exceeding audit log storage capacity. Organization-
defined actions include overwriting oldest audit records, shutting down the system, and stopping

the generation of audit records. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit
logging process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the failure, the severity of
the failure, or a combination of such factors. When the audit logging process failure is related to
storage, the response is carried out for the audit log storage repository (i.e., the distinct system
component where the audit logs are stored), the system on which the audit logs reside, the total
audit log storage capacity of the organization (i.e., all audit log storage repositories combined), or
all three. Organizations may decide to take no additional actions after alerting designated roles
or personnel.

mDiscussion:  Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide
hthese messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to alert
occurs in seconds or less).

SDiscussion:  Organizations have the capability to reject or delay the processing of network
.communications traffic if audit logging information about such traffic is determined to S
exceed the storage capacity of the system audit logging function. The rejection or delay .
response is triggered by the established organizational traffic volume thresholds that can be 0
adjusted based on changes to audit log storage capacity. 3

Selection: full system shutdown; partial system shutdown; degraded operational Invoke a [
mode with limited mission or business functionality availableAssignment: ] in the event of [
organization-defined audit logging failures], unless an alternate audit logging capability
exists.
Discussion:  Organizations determine the types of audit logging failures that can trigger
automatic system shutdowns or degraded operations. Because of the importance of
ensuring mission and business continuity, organizations may determine that the nature of
the audit logging failure is not so severe that it warrants a complete shutdown of the system

|  (5) RESPONSE TO AUDIT LOGGING PROCESS FAILURES  ALTERNATE AUDIT LOGGING CAPABILITY
Provide an alternate audit logging capability in the event of a failure in primary audit
Assignment: organization-defined alternate audit logging capability that implements [
logging functionality].
Discussion:  Since an alternate audit logging capability may be a short-term protection
solution employed until the failure in the primary audit logging capability is corrected,
organizations may determine that the alternate audit logging capability need only provide a
subset of the primary audit logging functionality that is impacted by the failure.
