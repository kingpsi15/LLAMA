A two-character identifier uniquely identifies each control family\nPS(e.g.,  for Personnel Security). Security and privacy controls may involve aspects of policy, n\noversight, supervision, manual processes, and automated mechanisms that are implemented by\nasystems or actions by individuals.

Control enhancements either add functionality or specificity to a base\ncontrol or increase the strength of a base control. Control enhancements are used in systems\nand environments of operation that require greater protection than the protection provided by\nthe base control. The need for organizations to select and implement control enhancements is\ndue to the potential adverse organizational or individual impacts or when organizations require\nadditions to the base control functionality or assurance based on assessments of risk. The\n25 Of the 20 control families in NIST SP 800-53, 17 are aligned with the minimum security requirements in [FIPS 200].\nThe Program Management (PM), PII Processing and Transparency (PT), and Supply Chain Risk Management (SR)\nfamilies address enterprise-level program management, privacy, and supply chain risk considerations pertaining to\nfederal mandates emergent since [FIPS 200].\nCHAPTER TWO  PAGE 8\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nalwaysselection and implementation of control enhancements  requires the selection and\nimplementation of the base control.\nThe families are arranged in alphabetical order, while the controls and control enhancements\nwithin each family are in numerical order.

Organizations can use\nthe information as needed when developing, tailoring, implementing, assessing, or monitoring\ncontrols. The information provides important considerations for implementing controls based\non mission or business requirements, operational environments, or assessments of risk. The\nadditional information can also explain the purpose of controls and often includes examples.\nControl enhancements may also include a separate discussion sectionwhen the discussion\ninformation is applicable only to a specific control enhancement.\nrelated controlsThe  section provides a list of controls from the control catalog that impact or\nsupport the implementation of a particular control or control enhancement, address a related h\nsecurity or privacy capability, or are referenced in the discussion section. Control enhancements p\nare inherently related to their base control. Thus, related controls that are referenced in the\nbase control are not repeated in the control enhancements. However, there may be related\nncontrols identified for control enhancements that are not referenced in the base control (i.e.,\nthe related control is only associated with the specific control enhancement). Controls may also a\nbe related to enhancements of other base controls. When a control is designated as a related\nbcontrol, a corresponding designation is made on that control in its source location in the catalog\nfto illustrate the two-way relationship. Additionally, each control in a given family is inherently r\nrelated to the -1 control (Policy and Procedures) in the same family. Therefore, the relationship\nrelated between the -1 control and the other controls in the same family is not specified in the c\ncontrols section for each control. r\ncontrol enhancementsThe  section provides statements of security and privacy capability that  m\naugment a base control. The control enhancements are numbered sequentially within each h\ncontrol so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement the\n/base control. Each control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended function or d\ni.capability provided by the enhancement. In the AU-4 example, if the control enhancement is\nselected, the control designation becomes AU-4(1). The numerical designation of a control\nenhancement is used only to identify that enhancement within the control. The designation is .\nnot indicative of the strength of the control enhancement, level of protection, priority, degree of 2\nNimportance, or any hierarchical relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements\nare not intended to be selected independently. That is, if a control enhancement is selected, T\nthen the corresponding base control is also selected and implemented.  P\n-referencesThe  section includes a list of applicable laws, policies, standards, guidelines, websites,\n26r The and other useful references that are relevant to a specific control or control enhancement.\nreferences section also includes hyperlinks to publications for obtaining additional information\nfor control development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring.\nFor some controls, additional flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to define specific\nvalues for designated parameters associated with the controls. Flexibility is achieved as part of a\nassignmentselectiontailoring process using  and  operations embedded within the controls and\n26 References are provided to assist organizations in understanding and implementing the security and privacy\ncontrols and are not intended to be inclusive or complete.\nCHAPTER TWO  PAGE 10"
