2.2CONTROLSTRUCTUREANDORGANIZATION
Security and privacy controls described in this publication have a well-defined organization and
structure. For ease of use in the security and privacy control selection and specification process,

aspecific topic of the family. A two-character identifier uniquely identifies each control family
PS(e.g.,  for Personnel Security). Security and privacy controls may involve aspects of policy, n
oversight, supervision, manual processes, and automated mechanisms that are implemented by
asystems or actions by individuals. Table 1 lists the security and privacy control families and their
associated family identifiers.  b

0Families of controls contain base controls and control enhancements, which are directly related
5to their base controls. Control enhancements either add functionality or specificity to a base
control or increase the strength of a base control. Control enhancements are used in systems
and environments of operation that require greater protection than the protection provided by
the base control. The need for organizations to select and implement control enhancements is
due to the potential adverse organizational or individual impacts or when organizations require
additions to the base control functionality or assurance based on assessments of risk. The
25 Of the 20 control families in NIST SP 800-53, 17 are aligned with the minimum security requirements in [FIPS 200].
The Program Management (PM), PII Processing and Transparency (PT), and Supply Chain Risk Management (SR)
families address enterprise-level program management, privacy, and supply chain risk considerations pertaining to
federal mandates emergent since [FIPS 200].

implementation of the base control.
The families are arranged in alphabetical order, while the controls and control enhancements
within each family are in numerical order. The order of the families, controls, and control
notenhancements does  imply any logical progression, level of prioritization or importance, or
order in which the controls or control enhancements are to be implemented. Rather, it reflects
the order in which they were included in the catalog. Control designations are not re-used when
a control is withdrawn.

Discussion:  Organizations consider the types of auditing to be performed and the audit
processing requirements when allocating audit storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit
storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the a
potential loss or reduction of auditing capability. e

privacy capabilities are achieved by the activities or actions, automated or nonautomated,
carried out by information systems and organizations. Organizations designate the responsibility
for control development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring. Organizations have the

mission or business needs consistent with law, regulation, and policy.
discussionThe  section provides additional information about a control. Organizations can use
the information as needed when developing, tailoring, implementing, assessing, or monitoring
controls. The information provides important considerations for implementing controls based
on mission or business requirements, operational environments, or assessments of risk. The
additional information can also explain the purpose of controls and often includes examples.
Control enhancements may also include a separate discussion sectionwhen the discussion
information is applicable only to a specific control enhancement.
related controlsThe  section provides a list of controls from the control catalog that impact or
support the implementation of a particular control or control enhancement, address a related h
security or privacy capability, or are referenced in the discussion section. Control enhancements p
are inherently related to their base control. Thus, related controls that are referenced in the
base control are not repeated in the control enhancements. However, there may be related
ncontrols identified for control enhancements that are not referenced in the base control (i.e.,
the related control is only associated with the specific control enhancement). Controls may also a
be related to enhancements of other base controls. When a control is designated as a related
bcontrol, a corresponding designation is made on that control in its source location in the catalog
fto illustrate the two-way relationship. Additionally, each control in a given family is inherently r
related to the -1 control (Policy and Procedures) in the same family. Therefore, the relationship
related between the -1 control and the other controls in the same family is not specified in the c
controls section for each control. r
control enhancementsThe  section provides statements of security and privacy capability that  m
augment a base control. The control enhancements are numbered sequentially within each h
control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement the
/base control. Each control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended function or d
i.capability provided by the enhancement. In the AU-4 example, if the control enhancement is
selected, the control designation becomes AU-4(1). The numerical designation of a control
enhancement is used only to identify that enhancement within the control. The designation is .
not indicative of the strength of the control enhancement, level of protection, priority, degree of 2
Nimportance, or any hierarchical relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements
are not intended to be selected independently. That is, if a control enhancement is selected, T
then the corresponding base control is also selected and implemented.  P

for control development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring.
For some controls, additional flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to define specific
values for designated parameters associated with the controls. Flexibility is achieved as part of a
