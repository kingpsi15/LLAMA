2.3CONTROLIMPLEMENTATIONAPPROACHES
commonThere are three approaches to implementing the controls in Chapter Three: (1) a
system-specific(inheritable) control implementation approach, (2) a  control implementation
hybridapproach, and (3) a  control implementation approach. The control implementation
approaches define the scope of applicability for the control, the shared nature or inheritability
of the control, and the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and

authorization. Each control implementation approach has a specific objective and focus that
helps organizations select the appropriate controls, implement the controls in an effective
manner, and satisfy security and privacy requirements. A specific control implementation
approach may achieve cost benefits by leveraging security and privacy capabilities across
27 multiple systems and environments of operation.
inheritableCommon controls are controls whose implementation results in a capability that is
by multiple systems or programs. A control is deemed inheritable when the system or program
receives protection from the implemented control, but the control is developed, implemented,
assessed, authorized, and monitored by an internal or external entity other than the entity
responsible for the system or program. The security and privacy capabilities provided by
common controls can be inherited from many sources, including mission or business lines,
horganizations, enclaves, environments of operation, sites, or other systems or programs.
pImplementing controls as common controls can introduce the risk of a single point of failure.
Many of the controls needed to protect organizational information systems—including many
nphysical and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls, and incident
response controls—are inheritable and, therefore, are good candidates for common control a
status. Common controls can also include technology-based controls, such as identification and
bauthentication controls, boundary protection controls, audit and accountability controls,  and
faccess controls. The cost of development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and r
monitoring can be amortized across multiple systems, organizational elements, and programs
using the common control implementation approach. c
system-specifichybridControls not implemented as common controls are implemented as  or
controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of the system owner and the  m
authorizing official for a given system. Implementing system-specific controls can introduce risk h
if the control implementations are not interoperable with common controls. Organizations can
/hybridimplement a control as  if one part of the control is common (inheritable) and the other d
i. using a part is system-specific. For example, an organization may implement control CP-2
predefined template for the contingency plan for all organizational information systems with
individual system owners tailoring the plan for system-specific uses, where appropriate. The .
division of a hybrid control into its common (inheritable) and system-specific parts may vary by 2
Norganization, depending on the types of information technologies employed, the approach used
by the organization to manage its controls, and assignment of responsibilities. When a control is T
implemented as a hybrid control, the common control provider is responsible for ensuring the   P
commonimplementation, assessment, and monitoring of the  part of the hybrid control, and the 0
-system owner is responsible for ensuring the implementation, assessment, and monitoring of 5
system-specificthe  part of the hybrid control. Implementing controls as hybrid controls can 5
introduce risk if the responsibility for the implementation and ongoing management of the
common and system-specific parts of the controls is unclear.
The determination as to the appropriate control implementation approach (i.e., common,
hybrid, or system-specific) is context-dependent. The control implementation approach cannot
be determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific simply based on the language of the
27 [SP 800-37] provides additional guidance on control implementation approaches (formerly referred to as control
Risk Management Frameworkdesignations) and how the different approaches are used in the .
