Each control implementation approach has a specific objective and focus that\nhelps organizations select the appropriate controls, implement the controls in an effective\nmanner, and satisfy security and privacy requirements. A specific control implementation\napproach may achieve cost benefits by leveraging security and privacy capabilities across\n27 multiple systems and environments of operation.\ninheritableCommon controls are controls whose implementation results in a capability that is\nby multiple systems or programs. A control is deemed inheritable when the system or program\nreceives protection from the implemented control, but the control is developed, implemented,\nassessed, authorized, and monitored by an internal or external entity other than the entity\nresponsible for the system or program. The security and privacy capabilities provided by\ncommon controls can be inherited from many sources, including mission or business lines,\nhorganizations, enclaves, environments of operation, sites, or other systems or programs.\npImplementing controls as common controls can introduce the risk of a single point of failure.\nMany of the controls needed to protect organizational information systems\u2014including many\nnphysical and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls, and incident\nresponse controls\u2014are inheritable and, therefore, are good candidates for common control a\nstatus. Common controls can also include technology-based controls, such as identification and\nbauthentication controls, boundary protection controls, audit and accountability controls,  and\nfaccess controls. The cost of development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and r\nmonitoring can be amortized across multiple systems, organizational elements, and programs\nusing the common control implementation approach. c\nsystem-specifichybridControls not implemented as common controls are implemented as  or\ncontrols. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of the system owner and the  m\nauthorizing official for a given system. Implementing system-specific controls can introduce risk h\nif the control implementations are not interoperable with common controls. Organizations can\n/hybridimplement a control as  if one part of the control is common (inheritable) and the other d\ni. using a part is system-specific. For example, an organization may implement control CP-2\npredefined template for the contingency plan for all organizational information systems with\nindividual system owners tailoring the plan for system-specific uses, where appropriate. The .\ndivision of a hybrid control into its common (inheritable) and system-specific parts may vary by 2\nNorganization, depending on the types of information technologies employed, the approach used\nby the organization to manage its controls, and assignment of responsibilities. When a control is T\nimplemented as a hybrid control, the common control provider is responsible for ensuring the   P\ncommonimplementation, assessment, and monitoring of the  part of the hybrid control, and the 0\n-system owner is responsible for ensuring the implementation, assessment, and monitoring of 5\nsystem-specificthe  part of the hybrid control. Implementing controls as hybrid controls can 5\nintroduce risk if the responsibility for the implementation and ongoing management of the\ncommon and system-specific parts of the controls is unclear.\nThe determination as to the appropriate control implementation approach (i.e., common,\nhybrid, or system-specific) is context-dependent. The control implementation approach cannot\nbe determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific simply based on the language of the\n27 [SP 800-37] provides additional guidance on control implementation approaches (formerly referred to as control\nRisk Management Frameworkdesignations) and how the different approaches are used in the .\nCHAPTER TWO  PAGE 12"
