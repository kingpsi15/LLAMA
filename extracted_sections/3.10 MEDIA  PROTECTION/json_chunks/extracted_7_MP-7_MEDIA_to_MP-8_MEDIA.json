Digital media includes\ndiskettes, magnetic tapes, flash drives, compact discs, digital versatile discs, and removable hard\ndisk drives. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Media use protections also apply to\nMP-2, which restricts user mobile devices with information storage capabilities. In contrast to\naccess to media, MP-7 restricts the use of certain types of media on systems, for example,\nrestricting or prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations use\ntechnical and nontechnical controls to restrict the use of system media. Organizations may\nrestrict the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations\nto prohibit access to certain external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 176\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nwrite to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only\napproved devices, including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other\napproved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may\nrestrict the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device, such as by prohibiting\nthe use of writeable, portable storage devices and implementing this restriction by disabling or\nremoving the capability to write to such devices. Requiring identifiable owners for storage\ndevices reduces the risk of using such devices by allowing organizations to assign responsibility\nfor addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices.\n.
