Digital media includes flash\ndrives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state,\nmagnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and\nmicrofilm. Physically controlling stored media includes conducting inventories, ensuring\nprocedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the library, and\nmaintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or\ncabinet or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate with the\nsecurity category or classification of the information on the media. Controlled areas are spaces\nthat provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for h\nprotecting information and systems. Fewer controls may be needed for media that contains\nbinformation determined to be in the public domain, publicly releasable, or have limited adverse\nimpacts on organizations, operations, or individuals if accessed by other than authorized a\nopersonnel. In these situations, physical access controls provide adequate protection.\nRelated Controls:  AC-19, CP-2, CP-6, CP-9, CP-10, MP-2, MP-7, PE-3, PL-2, SC-12, SC-13, SC-28, a\naSC-34, SI-12.\nlControl Enhancements: e\n| (1) eMEDIA STORAGE  CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-28(1).]\nr| (2) MEDIA STORAGE  AUTOMATED RESTRICTED ACCESS g\nRestrict access to media storage areas and log access attempts and access granted using r\nAssignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms[].\ntDiscussion:  Automated mechanisms include keypads, biometric readers, or card readers on t\nthe external entries to media storage areas. :\noRelated Controls:  AC-3, AU-2, AU-6, AU-9, AU-12, PE-3.\nReferences:  [FIPS 199], [SP 800-56A], [SP 800-56B], [SP 800-56C], [SP 800-57-1], [SP 800-57-2],\n[SP 800-57-3], [SP 800-111]."
