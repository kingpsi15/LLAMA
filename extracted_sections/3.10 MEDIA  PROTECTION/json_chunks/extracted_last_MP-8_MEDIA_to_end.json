P\nDiscussion:  Media downgrading applies to digital and non-digital media subject to release 0\noutside of the organization, whether the media is considered removable or not. When applied to\n5system media, the downgrading process removes information from the media, typically by\nsecurity category or classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or\nreconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable wider release\nand distribution. Downgrading ensures that empty space on the media is devoid of information.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  DOCUMENTATION OF PROCESS\nDocument system media downgrading actions.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 177\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  Organizations can document the media downgrading process by providing\ninformation, such as the downgrading technique employed, the identification number of the\ndowngraded media, and the identity of the individual that authorized and/or performed the\ndowngrading action.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  EQUIPMENT TESTING\nAssignment: organization-defined Test downgrading equipment and procedures [\nfrequency] to ensure that downgrading actions are being achieved.\nDiscussion:  None.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (3) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION\niDowngrade system media containing controlled unclassified information prior to public s\nrelease. u\nliDiscussion:  The downgrading of controlled unclassified information uses approved c\nsanitization tools, techniques, and procedures. i\niRelated Controls:  None. s\na| (4) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\nDowngrade system media containing classified information prior to release to individuals\nfwithout required access authorizations.\nDiscussion:  Downgrading of classified information uses approved sanitization tools,\ntechniques, and procedures to transfer information confirmed to be unclassified from c\nclassified systems to unclassified media.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  [32 CFR 2002], [NSA MEDIA].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 178"
