Examples include digital\nmedia in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components,\nmobile devices, and non-digital media (e.g., paper and microfilm). The sanitization process\nremoves information from system media such that the information cannot be retrieved or\nreconstructed. Sanitization techniques\u2014including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, de-\nidentification of personally identifiable information, and destruction\u2014prevent the disclosure of\ninformation to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal.\nOrganizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction is\nsometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 174\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOrganizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and\nprocedures for media that contains information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly\nreleasable or information deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if\nreleased for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction, removing a\nclassified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or\nwords from a document by obscuring the redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in\neffectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the\nsanitization process for media that contains classified information. NARA policies control the\nsanitization process for controlled unclassified information.\n.

Tracking and documenting actions include listing personnel a\nwho reviewed and approved sanitization and disposal actions, types of media sanitized, files\nisstored on the media, sanitization methods used, date and time of the sanitization actions,\nvpersonnel who performed the sanitization, verification actions taken and personnel who\nlperformed the verification, and the disposal actions taken. Organizations verify that the a\nlsanitization of the media was effective prior to disposal. e\neRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) MEDIA SANITIZATION  EQUIPMENT TESTING c\nAssignment: organization-defined frequencyTest sanitization equipment and procedures [] r\nto ensure that the intended sanitization is being achieved.\nmDiscussion:  Testing of sanitization equipment and procedures may be conducted by\nhqualified and authorized external entities, including federal agencies or external service\nproviders.\ndRelated Controls:  None.\n|r (3) MEDIA SANITIZATION  NONDESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUES g\n0Apply nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior to\nAssignment: 0connecting such devices to the system under the following circumstances: [\norganization-defined circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices].\nSDiscussion:  Portable storage devices include external or removable hard disk drives (e.g.,\n.solid state, magnetic), optical discs, magnetic or optical tapes, flash memory devices, flash S\nmemory cards, and other external or removable disks. Portable storage devices can be .\nobtained from untrustworthy sources and contain malicious code that can be inserted into 0\nor transferred to organizational systems through USB ports or other entry portals. While 3\nscanning storage devices is recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that\nsuch devices are free of malicious code. Organizations consider nondestructive sanitization\nof portable storage devices when the devices are purchased from manufacturers or vendors\nprior to initial use or when organizations cannot maintain a positive chain of custody for the\ndevices.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (4) MEDIA SANITIZATION  CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-6.]\n| (5) MEDIA SANITIZATION  CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 175\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-6.]\n| (6) MEDIA SANITIZATION  MEDIA DESTRUCTION\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-6.]\n| (7) MEDIA SANITIZATION  DUAL AUTHORIZATION\nAssignment: organization-defined Enforce dual authorization for the sanitization of [\nsystem media].\nDiscussion:  Organizations employ dual authorization to help ensure that system media\nsanitization cannot occur unless two technically qualified individuals conduct the designated\ntask. Individuals who sanitize system media possess sufficient skills and expertise to\ndetermine if the proposed sanitization reflects applicable federal and organizational\nstandards, policies, and procedures. Dual authorization also helps to ensure that sanitization\noccurs as intended, protecting against errors and false claims of having performed the h\nsanitization actions. Dual authorization may also be known as two-person control. To reduce\nthe risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating dual authorization duties to other b\nindividuals. a\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, MP-2. n\na| (8) MEDIA SANITIZATION  REMOTE PURGING OR WIPING OF INFORMATION\nlAssignment: organization-Provide the capability to purge or wipe information from [a\nldefined systems or system componentsSelection: remotely;under the following ] [ e\nrconditions: Assignment: organization-defined conditions[]]. e\noDiscussion:  Remote purging or wiping of information protects information on organizational\nsystems and system components if systems or components are obtained by unauthorized h\nrindividuals. Remote purge or wipe commands require strong authentication to help mitigate\nthe risk of unauthorized individuals purging or wiping the system, component, or device. The\npurge or wipe function can be implemented in a variety of ways, including by overwriting  m\ndata or information multiple times or by destroying the key necessary to decrypt encrypted h\npdata.\n/Related Controls:  None. d\nReferences:  [32 CFR 2002], [OMB A-130], [NARA CUI], [FIPS 199], [SP 800-60-1], [SP 800-60-2],\n/[SP 800-88], [SP 800-124], [IR 8023], [NSA MEDIA]. 1"
