The risk management strategy is an d\niimportant factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute .\ngto security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs\n0collaborate on the development of media protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy\nprogram policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may 0\n8obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be\nIincluded as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies\nthat reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and .\nprivacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures\n0describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or\nrole that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and 5\nprivacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to 5\nmedia protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents\nor breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,\nstandards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy\nor procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 171\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
