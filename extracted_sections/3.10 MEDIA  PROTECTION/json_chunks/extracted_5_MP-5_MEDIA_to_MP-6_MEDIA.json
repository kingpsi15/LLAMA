Digital media includes flash\ndrives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state and\nmagnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes microfilm and\npaper. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural\ncontrols to meet requirements established for protecting information and systems.

Activities associated with media transport include releasing media for transport,\nthe actual transport. ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes, and\nAuthorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals external to the organization.\nMaintaining accountability of media during transport includes restricting transport activities to\nauthorized personnel and tracking and/or obtaining records of transport activities as the media\nmoves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering.\nOrganizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated with the transport\nof system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk. Organizations maintain\nthe flexibility to define record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport as part\nof a system of transport-related records.\n.
