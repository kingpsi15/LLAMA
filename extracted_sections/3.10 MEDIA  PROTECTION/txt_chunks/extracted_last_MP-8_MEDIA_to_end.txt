Discussion:  Media downgrading applies to digital and non-digital media subject to release 0
outside of the organization, whether the media is considered removable or not. When applied to
5system media, the downgrading process removes information from the media, typically by
security category or classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or
reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable wider release
and distribution. Downgrading ensures that empty space on the media is devoid of information.
Related Controls:  None.

Discussion:  Organizations can document the media downgrading process by providing
information, such as the downgrading technique employed, the identification number of the
downgraded media, and the identity of the individual that authorized and/or performed the
downgrading action.
Related Controls:  None.
| (2) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  EQUIPMENT TESTING
Assignment: organization-defined Test downgrading equipment and procedures [
frequency] to ensure that downgrading actions are being achieved.
Discussion:  None.
Related Controls:  None.

liDiscussion:  The downgrading of controlled unclassified information uses approved c
sanitization tools, techniques, and procedures. i

a| (4) MEDIA DOWNGRADING  CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
Downgrade system media containing classified information prior to release to individuals
fwithout required access authorizations.
Discussion:  Downgrading of classified information uses approved sanitization tools,
techniques, and procedures to transfer information confirmed to be unclassified from c
classified systems to unclassified media.
Related Controls:  None.
