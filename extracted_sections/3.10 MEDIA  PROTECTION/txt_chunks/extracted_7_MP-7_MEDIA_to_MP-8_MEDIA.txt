Discussion:  System media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes
diskettes, magnetic tapes, flash drives, compact discs, digital versatile discs, and removable hard
disk drives. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Media use protections also apply to
MP-2, which restricts user mobile devices with information storage capabilities. In contrast to
access to media, MP-7 restricts the use of certain types of media on systems, for example,
restricting or prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations use
technical and nontechnical controls to restrict the use of system media. Organizations may
restrict the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations
to prohibit access to certain external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or

write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only
approved devices, including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other
approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may
restrict the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device, such as by prohibiting
the use of writeable, portable storage devices and implementing this restriction by disabling or
removing the capability to write to such devices. Requiring identifiable owners for storage
devices reduces the risk of using such devices by allowing organizations to assign responsibility
for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices.

oDiscussion:  Sanitization resistance refers to how resistant media are to non-destructive
isanitization techniques with respect to the capability to purge information from media. s
Certain types of media do not support sanitization commands, or if supported, the interfaces v
iare not supported in a standardized way across these devices. Sanitization-resistant media la
includes compact flash, embedded flash on boards and devices, solid state drives, and USB le
removable media. r
