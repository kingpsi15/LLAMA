Assignment: organization-defined types of digital a.Physically control and securely store [
and/or non-digital mediaAssignment: organization-defined controlled areas] within []; and
b.Protect system media types defined in MP-4a until the media are destroyed or sanitized
using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.
Discussion:  System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash
drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state,
magnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and
microfilm. Physically controlling stored media includes conducting inventories, ensuring
procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the library, and
maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or
cabinet or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate with the
security category or classification of the information on the media. Controlled areas are spaces
that provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for h
protecting information and systems. Fewer controls may be needed for media that contains
binformation determined to be in the public domain, publicly releasable, or have limited adverse
impacts on organizations, operations, or individuals if accessed by other than authorized a
opersonnel. In these situations, physical access controls provide adequate protection.
