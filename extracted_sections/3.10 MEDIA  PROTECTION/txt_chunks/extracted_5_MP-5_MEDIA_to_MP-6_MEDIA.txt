Discussion:  System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash
drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state and
magnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes microfilm and
paper. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural
controls to meet requirements established for protecting information and systems. Controls to
cryptography and locked containers. Cryptographic protect media during transport include

mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending on the mechanisms
implemented. Activities associated with media transport include releasing media for transport,
the actual transport. ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes, and
Authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals external to the organization.
Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes restricting transport activities to
authorized personnel and tracking and/or obtaining records of transport activities as the media
moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering.
Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated with the transport
of system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk. Organizations maintain
the flexibility to define record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport as part
of a system of transport-related records.

Employ an identified custodian during transport of system media outside of controlled
areas. e
fDiscussion:  Identified custodians provide organizations with specific points of contact during
the media transport process and facilitate individual accountability. Custodial responsibilities a
can be transferred from one individual to another if an unambiguous custodian is identified. e
