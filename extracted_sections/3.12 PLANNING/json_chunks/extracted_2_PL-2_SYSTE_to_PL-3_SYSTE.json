The plans\ndescribe the intended application of each selected control in the context of the system with a\nsufficient level of detail to correctly implement the control and to subsequently assess the\neffectiveness of the control. The control documentation describes how system-specific and\nhybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of\nthe system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of\nsystems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering processes. System security\nand privacy plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system\ndevelopment life cycle (e.g., during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for\nSection 2.1 describes the different types of requirements that are proposal, and design reviews).\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 195\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nrelevant to organizations during the system development life cycle and the relationship between\nrequirements and controls.\nOrganizations may develop a single, integrated security and privacy plan or maintain separate\nplans. Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a set of controls and\ncontrol enhancements. The plans describe how the controls and control enhancements meet the\nsecurity and privacy requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the\ndesign or implementation of the controls and control enhancements. Security and privacy plans\ncontain sufficient information (including specifications of control parameter values for selection\nand assignment operations explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation\nthat is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of\nrisk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if\nthe plan is implemented.\nSecurity and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection of various h\ndocuments, including documents that already exist. Effective security and privacy plans make\nbextensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents, including design\nand implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained. The use of a\noreferences helps reduce the documentation associated with security and privacy programs and\nimaintains the security- and privacy-related information in other established management and s\noperational areas, including enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems v\nlengineering, and acquisition. Security and privacy plans need not contain detailed contingency a\nlplan or incident response plan information but can instead provide\u2014explicitly or by reference\u2014e\nrsufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.\nSecurity- and privacy-related activities that may require coordination and planning with other f\nhindividuals or groups within the organization include assessments, audits, inspections, hardware\ngand software maintenance, acquisition and supply chain risk management, patch management,\nand contingency plan testing. Planning and coordination include emergency and nonemergency f\nm(i.e., planned or non-urgent unplanned) situations. The process defined by organizations to plan\nhand coordinate security- and privacy-related activities can also be included in other documents,\nas appropriate. s\n, Related Controls:  AC-2, AC-6, AC-14, AC-17, AC-20, CA-2, CA-3, CA-7, CM-9, CM-13, CP-2, CP-4o\nIR-4, IR-8, MA-4, MA-5, MP-4, MP-5, PL-7, PL-8, PL-10, PL-11, PM-1, PM-7, PM-8, PM-9, PM-10,\n/PM-11, RA-3, RA-8, RA-9, SA-5, SA-17, SA-22, SI-12, SR-2, SR-4. 1\nControl Enhancements: 0\nN| (1) SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY PLANS  CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS\nT[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-7.]\n.| (2) SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY PLANS  FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE8\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-8.] -\n5|(3) SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY PLANS  PLAN AND COORDINATE WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONAL\nENTITIES\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-2.]\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-18], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-160-1], [SP 800-160-2]."
