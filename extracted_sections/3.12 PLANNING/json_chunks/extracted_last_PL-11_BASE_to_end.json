Tailoring actions facilitate such .\nspecialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security and privacy plans\n0that reflect their specific mission and business functions, the environments where their systems\n5operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or\nSP situations that can impact their mission or business success. Tailoring guidance is provided in [5\n800-53B]. Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common\ncontrols, applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning values to\ncontrol parameters, supplementing the control baseline with additional controls as needed, and\nSP 800-53B] providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in [\ncan be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring\nSP 800-53B] in accordance with the security and actions can be applied to the baselines in [\nprivacy requirements from [FISMA], [PRIVACT], and [OMB A-130]. Alternatively, other\ncommunities of interest adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in [SP\n800-53B] to specialize or customize the controls that represent the specific needs and concerns\nof those entities.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 201\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  PL-10, RA-2, RA-3, RA-9, SA-8.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [FIPS 199], [FIPS 200], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-53B], [SP 800-\n60-1], [SP 800-60-2], [SP 800-160-1], [CNSSI 1253].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 202"
