The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing d\nisuch policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy .\ngassurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on their\n0development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are\npreferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific policies and 0\n8procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be\nIrepresented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can\nbe established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for .\nsystems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can\n0be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be\ndocumented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events 5\nthat may precipitate an update to planning policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, 5\nassessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not\nconstitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-18], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 194\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
