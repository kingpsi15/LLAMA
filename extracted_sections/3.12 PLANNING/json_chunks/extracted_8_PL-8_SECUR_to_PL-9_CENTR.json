[OMB M-19-03] requires the use of the systems security\nengineering concepts described in [SP 800-160-1] for high value assets. Security and privacy\narchitectures are reviewed and updated throughout the system development life cycle, from\nanalysis of alternatives through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the\npreliminary design reviews and design reviews before and during implementation (e.g., during\ncritical design reviews).\nIn today\u2019s modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations to\ncontrol all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information h\nservices and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy\nbarchitectures is necessary for developing a comprehensive mission and business protection\nstrategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control a a\nobaseline configuration for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining\nieffective architectures. The development of the architectures is coordinated with the senior s\nagency information security officer and the senior agency official for privacy to ensure that the v\nlcontrols needed to support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively a\nlimplemented. In many circumstances, there may be no distinction between the security and e\nrprivacy architecture for a system. In other circumstances, security objectives may be adequately\nsatisfied, but privacy objectives may only be partially satisfied by the security requirements. In\nthese cases, consideration of the privacy requirements needed to achieve satisfaction will result c\nin a distinct privacy architecture. The documentation, however, may simply reflect the combined\nearchitectures.\nm is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that architectures are developed for the PL-8\nhsystem and, moreover, that the architectures are integrated with or tightly coupled to the\nSA-17 is primarily directed at the external information enterprise architecture. In contrast, s\n/technology product and system developers and integrators. SA-17, which is complementary to d\niPL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of systems or components to .\ngexternal entities and when there is a need to demonstrate consistency with the organization\u2019s\n0enterprise architecture and security and privacy architectures.\n2Related Controls:  CM-2, CM-6, PL-2, PL-7, PL-9, PM-5, PM-7, RA-9, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-17, SC-7.\nIControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARCHITECTURES  DEFENSE IN DEPTH\nDesign the security and privacy architectures for the system using a defense-in-depth 0\n-approach that: 5\n5Assignment: organization-defined controlsAssignment: organization-(a)Allocates [] to [\ndefined locations and architectural layers]; and\n(b)Ensures that the allocated controls operate in a coordinated and mutually reinforcing\nmanner.\nDiscussion:  Organizations strategically allocate security and privacy controls in the security\nand privacy architectures so that adversaries must overcome multiple controls to achieve\ntheir objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple controls makes it more difficult to\nattack information resources by increasing the work factor of the adversary; it also increases\nthe likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated controls is essential to ensure that\nan attack that involves one control does not create adverse, unintended consequences by\ninterfering with other controls. Unintended consequences can include system lockout and\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 199\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\ncascading alarms.

For example,\nvendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at different times, is\noften developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms based on their priorities\nand development schedules. By deploying different products at different locations, there is lic\nan increased likelihood that at least one of the products will detect the malicious code. With t\nnrespect to privacy, vendors may offer products that track personally identifiable information\nin systems. Products may use different tracking methods. Using multiple products may result\nin more assurance that personally identifiable information is inventoried. a\nbRelated Controls:  SC-29, SR-3.\nrReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-160-1], [SP 800-160-2]. e"
