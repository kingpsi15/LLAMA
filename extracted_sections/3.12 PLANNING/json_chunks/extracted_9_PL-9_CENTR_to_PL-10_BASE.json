This includes planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing,\ntand monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed controls and processes. As the p\n:central management of controls is generally associated with the concept of common (inherited) /\nocontrols, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of control implementations\nand management and the judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally managed controls r\n1and processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial\n6and ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring.\nAutomated tools (e.g., security information and event management tools or enterprise security /\nmonitoring and management tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of S\n.information associated with centrally managed controls and processes. Automation can also\nprovide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities; alerting mechanisms; and dashboards .\nto support risk-based decision-making within the organization.\nAs part of the control selection processes, organizations determine the controls that may be\nsuitable for central management based on resources and capabilities. It is not always possible to\ncentrally manage every aspect of a control. In such cases, the control can be treated as a hybrid\ncontrol with the control managed and implemented centrally or at the system level.
