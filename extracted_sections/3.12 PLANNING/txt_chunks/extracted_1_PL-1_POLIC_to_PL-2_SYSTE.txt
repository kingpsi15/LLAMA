Discussion:  Planning policy and procedures for the controls in the PL family implemented within s
/systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing d
isuch policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy .
gassurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on their
0development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific policies and 0
8procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be
Irepresented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can
be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for .
systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can
0be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be
documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events 5
that may precipitate an update to planning policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, 5
assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders,
directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not
constitute an organizational policy or procedure.
