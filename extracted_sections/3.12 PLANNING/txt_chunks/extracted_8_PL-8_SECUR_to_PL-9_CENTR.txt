Discussion:  The security and privacy architectures at the system level are consistent with the
organization-wide security and privacy architectures described in PM-7, which are integral to and
developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The architectures include an architectural
description, the allocation of security and privacy functionality (including controls), security- and
privacy-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the
interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. The architectures can

and system services; and other protection needs.
] provides guidance on the use of security architectures as part of the system [SP 800-160-1
development life cycle process. [OMB M-19-03] requires the use of the systems security
engineering concepts described in [SP 800-160-1] for high value assets. Security and privacy
architectures are reviewed and updated throughout the system development life cycle, from
analysis of alternatives through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the
preliminary design reviews and design reviews before and during implementation (e.g., during
critical design reviews).
In today’s modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations to
control all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information h
services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy
barchitectures is necessary for developing a comprehensive mission and business protection
strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control a a
obaseline configuration for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining
ieffective architectures. The development of the architectures is coordinated with the senior s
agency information security officer and the senior agency official for privacy to ensure that the v
lcontrols needed to support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively a
limplemented. In many circumstances, there may be no distinction between the security and e
rprivacy architecture for a system. In other circumstances, security objectives may be adequately
satisfied, but privacy objectives may only be partially satisfied by the security requirements. In
these cases, consideration of the privacy requirements needed to achieve satisfaction will result c
in a distinct privacy architecture. The documentation, however, may simply reflect the combined
earchitectures.

hsystem and, moreover, that the architectures are integrated with or tightly coupled to the

Discussion:  Organizations strategically allocate security and privacy controls in the security
and privacy architectures so that adversaries must overcome multiple controls to achieve
their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple controls makes it more difficult to
attack information resources by increasing the work factor of the adversary; it also increases
the likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated controls is essential to ensure that
an attack that involves one control does not create adverse, unintended consequences by
interfering with other controls. Unintended consequences can include system lockout and

cascading alarms. The placement of controls in systems and organizations is an important
activity that requires thoughtful analysis. The value of organizational assets is an important
consideration in providing additional layering. Defense-in-depth architectural approaches
), separation of system and user functionality include modularity and layering (see SA-8(3)

Discussion:  Information technology products have different strengths and weaknesses.
Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings. For example,
vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at different times, is
often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms based on their priorities
and development schedules. By deploying different products at different locations, there is lic
an increased likelihood that at least one of the products will detect the malicious code. With t
nrespect to privacy, vendors may offer products that track personally identifiable information
in systems. Products may use different tracking methods. Using multiple products may result
in more assurance that personally identifiable information is inventoried. a
