0PL-11 BASELINE TAILORING
2Control:  Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.   8
IDiscussion:  The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a set of
baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. Tailoring actions facilitate such .
specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security and privacy plans
0that reflect their specific mission and business functions, the environments where their systems
5operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or
SP situations that can impact their mission or business success. Tailoring guidance is provided in [5
800-53B]. Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common
controls, applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning values to
control parameters, supplementing the control baseline with additional controls as needed, and
SP 800-53B] providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in [
can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring
SP 800-53B] in accordance with the security and actions can be applied to the baselines in [
privacy requirements from [FISMA], [PRIVACT], and [OMB A-130]. Alternatively, other
communities of interest adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in [SP
800-53B] to specialize or customize the controls that represent the specific needs and concerns
of those entities.
