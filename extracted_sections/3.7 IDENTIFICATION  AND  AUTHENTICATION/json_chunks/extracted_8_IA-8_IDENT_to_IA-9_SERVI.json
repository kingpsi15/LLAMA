Non-organizational users are uniquely identified and authenticated for\naccesses other than those explicitly identified and documented in AC-14. Identification and\nauthentication of non-organizational users accessing federal systems may be required to protect\nfederal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security\nsystems). Organizations consider many factors\u2014including security, privacy, scalability, and\npracticality\u2014when balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information\nand systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk.\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-6, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, AU-6, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-10, IA-11, MA-4, RA-\n3, SA-4, SC-8.\nControl Enhancements:\n(-)|T(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION NONORGANIZATIONAL USERS  ACCEPTANCE OF PIV\nis CREDENTIALS FROM OTHER AGENCIES\nAccept and electronically verify Personal Identity Verification-compliant credentials from b\nother federal agencies. a\nDiscussion:  Acceptance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials from other federal n\nisagencies applies to both logical and physical access control systems.

The acceptance and verification of PIV-I-compliant\ncredentials apply to both logical and physical access control systems. The acceptance and\nverification of PIV-I credentials address nonfederal issuers of identity cards that desire to\ninteroperate with United States Government PIV systems and that can be trusted by Federal\nGovernment-relying parties. The X.509 certificate policy for the Federal Bridge Certification\nAuthority (FBCA) addresses PIV-I requirements. The PIV-I card is commensurate with the PIV\ncredentials as defined in cited references. PIV-I credentials are the credentials issued by a\nTPIV-I provider whose PIV-I certificate policy maps to the Federal Bridge PIV-I Certificate\nisPolicy. A PIV-I provider is cross-certified with the FBCA (directly or through another PKI\nubridge) with policies that have been mapped and approved as meeting the requirements of\nlithe PIV-I policies defined in the FBCA certificate policy. c\noRelated Controls:  None.\n(-)| (6) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION NONORGANIZATIONAL USERS  DISASSOCIABILITYa\nImplement the following measures to disassociate user attributes or identifier assertion i\nrelationships among individuals, credential service providers, and relying parties: le\nfAssignment: organization-defined measures[]. r\nDiscussion:  Federated identity solutions can create increased privacy risks due to the\ntracking and profiling of individuals. Using identifier mapping tables or cryptographic c\ntechniques to blind credential service providers and relying parties from each other or to\nemake identity attributes less visible to transmitting parties can reduce these privacy risks.\nRelated Controls:  None. m\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [FED PKI], [FIPS 201-2], [SP 800-63-3], [SP 800-79-2], [SP 800-116], [IR t\ns8062]."
