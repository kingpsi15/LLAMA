The forms of acceptable evidence are consistent with the risks to the systems, h\nroles, and privileges associated with the user\u2019s account.  g\nfRelated Controls:  None. r\n|  (3) IDENTITY PROOFING  IDENTITY EVIDENCE VALIDATION AND VERIFICATIONh\nRequire that the presented identity evidence be validated and verified through s\n/Assignment: organizational defined methods of validation and verification[]. d\ni.Discussion:  Validation and verification of identity evidence increases the assurance that o\naccounts and identifiers are being established for the correct user and authenticators are /\nbeing bound to that user. Validation refers to the process of confirming that the evidence is .\ngenuine and authentic, and the data contained in the evidence is correct, current, and 2\n/related to an individual. Verification confirms and establishes a linkage between the claimed\nSidentity and the actual existence of the user presenting the evidence. Acceptable methods\n.for validating and verifying identity evidence are consistent with the risks to the systems, S\nroles, and privileges associated with the users account. .\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|- 5(4) IDENTITY PROOFING  INPERSON VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION\nRequire that the validation and verification of identity evidence be conducted in person\nbefore a designated registration authority.\nDiscussion:  In-person proofing reduces the likelihood of fraudulent credentials being issued\nbecause it requires the physical presence of individuals, the presentation of physical identity\ndocuments, and actual face-to-face interactions with designated registration authorities.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (5) IDENTITY PROOFING  ADDRESS CONFIRMATION\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 147\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSelection: registration code; notice of proofingRequire that a [] be delivered through an\nout-of-band channel to verify the users address (physical or digital) of record.\nDiscussion:  To make it more difficult for adversaries to pose as legitimate users during the\nidentity proofing process, organizations can use out-of-band methods to ensure that the\nindividual associated with an address of record is the same individual that participated in the\nregistration. Confirmation can take the form of a temporary enrollment code or a notice of\nproofing. The delivery address for these artifacts is obtained from records and not self-\nasserted by the user. The address can include a physical or digital address. A home address is\nan example of a physical address. Email addresses and telephone numbers are examples of\ndigital addresses.\nRelated Controls:  IA-12.\n|- (6) IDENTITY PROOFING  ACCEPT EXTERNALLYPROOFED IDENTITIES\nAssignment: organization-defined identity Accept externally-proofed identities at [is\nassurance level].\nliDiscussion:  To limit unnecessary re-proofing of identities, particularly of non-PIV users, c\ntorganizations accept proofing conducted at a commensurate level of assurance by other i\nagencies or organizations. Proofing is consistent with organizational security policy and the\nidentity assurance level appropriate for the system, application, or information accessed.a\nAccepting externally-proofed identities is a fundamental component of managing federated\nbidentities across agencies and organizations.\nfRelated Controls:  IA-3, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8. r\noReferences:  [FIPS 201-2], [SP 800-63-3], [SP 800-63A], [SP 800-79-2].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 148"
