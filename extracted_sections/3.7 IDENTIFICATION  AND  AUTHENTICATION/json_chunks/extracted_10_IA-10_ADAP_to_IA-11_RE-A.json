  "content": "IA-10 ADAPTIVE AUTHENTICATION\nAssignment: organization-defined Control:  Require individuals accessing the system to employ [\nsupplemental authentication techniques or mechanismsAssignment: ] under specific [\norganization-defined circumstances or situations].\nDiscussion:  Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms employed by\norganizations and subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. To address this threat,\norganizations may employ specific techniques or mechanisms and establish protocols to assess\nsuspicious behavior. Suspicious behavior may include accessing information that individuals do h\nnot typically access as part of their duties, roles, or responsibilities; accessing greater quantities\nof information than individuals would routinely access; or attempting to access information from b\nsuspicious network addresses. When pre-established conditions or triggers occur, organizations\nocan require individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use\nifor adaptive authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number or s\ntypes of records being accessed. Adaptive authentication does not replace and is not used to v\niavoid the use of multi-factor authentication mechanisms but can augment implementations of la\nmulti-factor authentication. le\nRelated Controls:  IA-2, IA-8.\nControl Enhancements:  None. c\nReferences:  [SP 800-63-3].  g"
