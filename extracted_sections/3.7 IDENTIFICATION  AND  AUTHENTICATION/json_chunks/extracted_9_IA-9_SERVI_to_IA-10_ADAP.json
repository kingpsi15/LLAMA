Identification and\n.authentication methods for system services and applications include information or code signing,\n0provenance graphs, and electronic signatures that indicate the sources of services. Decisions\nregarding the validity of identification and authentication claims can be made by services 3\nseparate from the services acting on those decisions. This can occur in distributed system\narchitectures. In such situations, the identification and authentication decisions (instead of actual\nidentifiers and authentication data) are provided to the services that need to act on those\ndecisions.\nRelated Controls:  IA-3, IA-4, IA-5, SC-8.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SERVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION  INFORMATION EXCHANGE\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into IA-9.]\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 145\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n| (2) SERVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION  TRANSMISSION OF DECISIONS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into IA-9.]\nReferences:  None."
