Device authenticators include certificates and\n5passwords. Initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial\n5password). In contrast, the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria or\ncharacteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver system components\nwith factory default authentication credentials (i.e., passwords) to allow for initial installation\nand configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable,\nand present a significant risk.

Long passwords or passphrases are\n:preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal security /\nobenefits while decreasing usability. However, organizations may choose to establish certain\nrules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length for long passwords) under r\ncertain circumstances and can enforce this requirement in IA-5(1)(h).

For PKI solutions, status information for certification paths includes\ncertificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, certificate\nvalidation involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common\nPolicy Root trust anchor, which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing a local\ncache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system\navailability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation information via\nthe network.\nRelated Controls:  IA-3, SC-17.\n|- (3) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  INPERSON OR TRUSTED EXTERNAL PARTY REGISTRATION\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into IA-12(4).]\nT|(4) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PASSWORD STRENGTH\nis DETERMINATION\nb[Withdrawn: Incorporated into IA-5(1).]\nt|  (5) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  CHANGE AUTHENTICATORS PRIOR TO DELIVERYi\nRequire developers and installers of system components to provide unique authenticators is\nor change default authenticators prior to delivery and installation. v\nlDiscussion:  Changing authenticators prior to the delivery and installation of system a\nlcomponents extends the requirement for organizations to change default authenticators e\nrupon system installation by requiring developers and/or installers to provide unique e\nauthenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery o\ncand/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to developers of commercial off-the-\nshelf information technology products.

Organizations exercise caution when determining whether embedded or\nstored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in\nthe manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (8) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  MULTIPLE SYSTEM ACCOUNTS\nAssignment: organization-defined security controlsImplement [] to manage the risk of\ncompromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 140\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  When individuals have accounts on multiple systems and use the same\nauthenticators such as passwords, there is the risk that a compromise of one account may\nlead to the compromise of other accounts. Alternative approaches include having different\nauthenticators (passwords) on all systems, employing a single sign-on or federation\nmechanism, or using some form of one-time passwords on all systems.

Using a specific list of approved external organizations for\nauthentication helps to ensure that those organizations are vetted and trusted. lic\ntRelated Controls:  AU-7, AU-16. i\nis| (10) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  DYNAMIC CREDENTIAL BINDING\naAssignment: Bind identities and authenticators dynamically using the following rules: [\norganization-defined binding rules]. b\nDiscussion:  Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and the f\neauthenticator that is used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, binding is\nfestablished by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the system. For\nexample, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator) a\nis accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the system. New\nauthentication techniques allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator to r\nbe implemented external to a system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity\nand authenticator are bound together on the smartcard. Using these credentials, systems t\nscan authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning the\ndidentity after authentication. In these situations, organizations can anticipate the dynamic\ni.provisioning of identities. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with o\nappropriate authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential.\n.Related Controls:  AU-16, IA-5. 6\n8|- (11) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  HARDWARE TOKENBASED AUTHENTICATION\nS[Withdrawn: Incorporated into IA-2(1) and IA-2(2).]\n| P(12) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION PERFORMANCE\nFor biometric-based authentication, employ mechanisms that satisfy the following\n5Assignment: organization-defined biometric quality biometric quality requirements [\n5requirements ].\nDiscussion:  Unlike password-based authentication, which provides exact matches of user-\ninput passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does not provide exact\nmatches. Depending on the type of biometric and the type of collection mechanism, there is\nlikely to be some divergence from the presented biometric and the stored biometric that\nserves as the basis for comparison. Matching performance is the rate at which a biometric\nalgorithm correctly results in a match for a genuine user and rejects other users. Biometric\nperformance requirements include the match rate, which reflects the accuracy of the\nbiometric matching algorithm used by a system.\nRelated Controls:  AC-7.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 141\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n| (13) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  EXPIRATION OF CACHED AUTHENTICATORS\nAssignment: organization-defined time Prohibit the use of cached authenticators after [\nperiod].\nDiscussion:  Cached authenticators are used to authenticate to the local machine when the\nnetwork is not available.

Such characteristics can be\nobtained by online web accesses, taking a picture of someone with a camera phone to\nobtain facial images with or without their knowledge, lifting from objects that someone has\ntouched (e.g., a latent fingerprint), or capturing a high-resolution image (e.g., an iris\npattern). Presentation attack detection technologies including liveness detection, can\nmitigate the risk of these types of attacks by making it difficult to produce artifacts intended\nto defeat the biometric sensor.\nRelated Controls:  AC-7.\n|(18)  AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  PASSWORD MANAGERS\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 142\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAssignment: organization-defined password managers(a)Employ [] to generate and\nmanage passwords; and\nAssignment: organization-defined controls(b)Protect the passwords using [].\nDiscussion:  For systems where static passwords are employed, it is often a challenge to\nensure that the passwords are suitably complex and that the same passwords are not\nemployed on multiple systems. A password manager is a solution to this problem as it\nautomatically generates and stores strong and different passwords for various accounts. A\npotential risk of using password managers is that adversaries can target the collection of\npasswords generated by the password manager.
