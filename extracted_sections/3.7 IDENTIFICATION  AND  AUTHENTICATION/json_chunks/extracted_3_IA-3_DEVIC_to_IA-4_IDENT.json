Organization-defined device types a\ninclude devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information e\nr(e.g., Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] o\naddresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of :\ntElectrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP],\nRADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and\nauthenticate devices on local and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required\nostrength of authentication mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and mission\nor business requirements. Because of the challenges of implementing device authentication on a /\nlarge scale, organizations can restrict the application of the control to a limited number/type of .\ndevices based on mission or business needs. 2\nRelated Controls:  AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AU-6, CA-3, CA-9, IA-4, IA-5, IA-9, IA-11, SI-4.

A network connection is a connection with a device that communicates\nthrough a network. A remote connection is a connection with a device that communicates\nthrough an external network. Bidirectional authentication provides stronger protection to\nvalidate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.\nRelated Controls:  SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.\n|(2) DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION  CRYPTOGRAPHIC BIDIRECTIONAL NETWORK\nAUTHENTICATION\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 135\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into IA-3(1).]\n| (3) DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION  DYNAMIC ADDRESS ALLOCATION\n(a)Where addresses are allocated dynamically, standardize dynamic address allocation\nlease information and the lease duration assigned to devices in accordance with\nAssignment: organization-defined lease information and lease duration[]; and\n(b)Audit lease information when assigned to a device.\nDiscussion:  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an example of a means by\nwhich clients can dynamically receive network address assignments.\nRelated Controls:  AU-2.\n| (4) DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION  DEVICE ATTESTATION\nAssignment: Handle device identification and authentication based on attestation by [T\norganization-defined configuration management processi]. s\nuDiscussion:  Device attestation refers to the identification and authentication of a device\nlibased on its configuration and known operating state. Device attestation can be determined c\nvia a cryptographic hash of the device. If device attestation is the means of identification and i\nauthentication, then it is important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a\naconfiguration management process such that the patches and updates are done securely\nand do not disrupt identification and authentication to other devices. i\nRelated Controls:  CM-2, CM-3, CM-6. le\nReferences:  None."
