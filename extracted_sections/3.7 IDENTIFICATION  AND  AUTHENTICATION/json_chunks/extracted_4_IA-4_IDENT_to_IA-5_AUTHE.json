The management of individual\nidentifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the I\nusernames of the system accounts assigned to those individuals.

Prohibiting the use of systems account identifiers that are the same as some\npublic identifier, such as the individual identifier section of an electronic mail address, makes\nit more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers. Prohibiting account identifiers as\npublic identifiers without the implementation of other supporting controls only complicates\nguessing of identifiers. Additional protections are required for authenticators and credentials\nto protect the account.\n.Related Controls:  AT-2, PT-7\n| (2) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT  SUPERVISOR AUTHORIZATION\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into IA-12(1).]\n| (3) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT  MULTIPLE FORMS OF CERTIFICATION\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into IA-12(2).]\nis| (4) IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT  IDENTIFY USER STATUS\nbAssignment: Manage individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as [\norganization-defined characteristic identifying individual status ].a\nDiscussion:  Characteristics that identify the status of individuals include contractors, foreign n\nnationals, and non-organizational users. Identifying the status of individuals by these\ncharacteristics provides additional information about the people with whom organizational a\nlapersonnel are communicating.

When identifiers are established at runtime for s\npreviously unknown entities, organizations can anticipate and provision for the dynamic d\ni.establishment of identifiers.
