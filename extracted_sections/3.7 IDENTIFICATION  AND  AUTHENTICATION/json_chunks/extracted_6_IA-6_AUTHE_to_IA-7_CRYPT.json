  "content": "IA-6 AUTHENTICATION FEEDBACK\nControl:  Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to is\nprotect the information from possible exploitation and use by unauthorized individuals.\nlaDiscussion:  Authentication feedback from systems does not provide information that would\nallow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of\nesystems, such as desktops or notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (referred to as\noshoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems, such as mobile devices with\nsmall displays, the threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood h\nrof typographic input errors due to small keyboards. Thus, the means for obscuring authentication\nfeedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authentication feedback includes displaying asterisks\nwhen users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time m\nbefore obscuring it. h\nRelated Controls:  AC-3.\nControl Enhancements:  None. i.\nReferences:  None. /"
