  "content": "IA-2 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)\nControl:  Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique\nidentification with processes acting on behalf of those users.\nDiscussion:  Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements by\ncomplying with the requirements in [HSPD 12]. Organizational users include employees or\nindividuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g.,\ncontractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to\nAC-14 and that occur through the all accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in\nauthorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes\nexecute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of\nindividuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\nTOrganizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user\niidentities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to s\nuorganizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\nliaccess to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is c\ntobtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to i\norganizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained\nthrough network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access a\nthat involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area\nbnetworks and wide area networks.\nrThe use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-e\ncontrolled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal o\ncnetworks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing\nthe network.

Implement multi-factor authentication for access to privileged accounts.6\nDiscussion:  Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to 8\nachieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you\nTknow (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical\nauthenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). P\nMulti-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware\n-authenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such\nas the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the Department of r\nDefense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to authenticating users at the system\nlevel (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application\nlevel, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e.,\nlocal, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options\nappropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as\nadditional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.\nRelated Controls:  AC-5, AC-6.\n()|-(2) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION ORGANIZATIONAL USERS  MULTIFACTOR\n-  AUTHENTICATION TO NONPRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 132\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nImplement multi-factor authentication for access to non-privileged accounts.\nDiscussion:  Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to\nachieve authentication.

The first path\n(i.e., the in-band path) is used to identify and authenticate users or devices and is generally\nthe path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band path) is\nused to independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example, a\nuser authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires\naccess and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently,\nthe server contacts the user via the user\u2019s cell phone to verify that the requested action\noriginated from the user. The user may confirm the intended action to an individual on the\ntelephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. Out-of-band authentication\ncan be used to mitigate actual or suspected \u201cman-in the-middle\u201d attacks. The conditions or\ncriteria for activation include suspicious activities, new threat indicators, elevated threat\nlevels, or the impact or classification level of information in requested transactions.\nRelated Controls:  IA-10, IA-11, SC-37. is\nReferences:  [FIPS 140-3], [FIPS 201-2], [FIPS 202], [SP 800-63-3], [SP 800-73-4], [SP 800-76-2], [SP\nlic800-78-4], [SP 800-79-2], [SP 800-156], [SP 800-166], [IR 7539], [IR 7676], [IR 7817], [IR 7849], [IR\ni7870], [IR 7874], [IR 7966]. o"
