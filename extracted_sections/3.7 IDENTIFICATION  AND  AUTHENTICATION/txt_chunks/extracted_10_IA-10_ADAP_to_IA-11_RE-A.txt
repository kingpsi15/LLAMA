IA-10 ADAPTIVE AUTHENTICATION
Assignment: organization-defined Control:  Require individuals accessing the system to employ [
supplemental authentication techniques or mechanismsAssignment: ] under specific [
organization-defined circumstances or situations].
Discussion:  Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms employed by
organizations and subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. To address this threat,
organizations may employ specific techniques or mechanisms and establish protocols to assess
suspicious behavior. Suspicious behavior may include accessing information that individuals do h
not typically access as part of their duties, roles, or responsibilities; accessing greater quantities
of information than individuals would routinely access; or attempting to access information from b
suspicious network addresses. When pre-established conditions or triggers occur, organizations
ocan require individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use
ifor adaptive authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number or s
types of records being accessed. Adaptive authentication does not replace and is not used to v
iavoid the use of multi-factor authentication mechanisms but can augment implementations of la
multi-factor authentication. le
