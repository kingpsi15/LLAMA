Discussion:  Non-organizational users include system users other than organizational users
explicitly covered by IA-2. Non-organizational users are uniquely identified and authenticated for
accesses other than those explicitly identified and documented in AC-14. Identification and
authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal systems may be required to protect
federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security
systems). Organizations consider many factors—including security, privacy, scalability, and
practicality—when balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information
and systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk.

Discussion:  Organizations define profiles for identity management based on open identity
management standards. To ensure that open identity management standards are viable,
robust, reliable, sustainable, and interoperable as documented, the Federal Government
assesses and scopes the standards and technology implementations against applicable laws,
executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.

CREDENTIALS
Assignment: organization-Accept and verify federated or PKI credentials that meet [
defined policy ].
Discussion:  Acceptance of PIV-I credentials can be implemented by PIV, PIV-I, and other
commercial or external identity providers. The acceptance and verification of PIV-I-compliant
credentials apply to both logical and physical access control systems. The acceptance and
verification of PIV-I credentials address nonfederal issuers of identity cards that desire to
interoperate with United States Government PIV systems and that can be trusted by Federal
Government-relying parties. The X.509 certificate policy for the Federal Bridge Certification
Authority (FBCA) addresses PIV-I requirements. The PIV-I card is commensurate with the PIV
credentials as defined in cited references. PIV-I credentials are the credentials issued by a
TPIV-I provider whose PIV-I certificate policy maps to the Federal Bridge PIV-I Certificate
isPolicy. A PIV-I provider is cross-certified with the FBCA (directly or through another PKI
ubridge) with policies that have been mapped and approved as meeting the requirements of
lithe PIV-I policies defined in the FBCA certificate policy. c

fAssignment: organization-defined measures[]. r
Discussion:  Federated identity solutions can create increased privacy risks due to the
tracking and profiling of individuals. Using identifier mapping tables or cryptographic c
techniques to blind credential service providers and relying parties from each other or to
emake identity attributes less visible to transmitting parties can reduce these privacy risks.
