IA-2 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)
Control:  Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique
identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.
Discussion:  Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements by
complying with the requirements in [HSPD 12]. Organizational users include employees or
individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g.,
contractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to
AC-14 and that occur through the all accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in
authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes
execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of
individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.
TOrganizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user
iidentities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to s
uorganizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any
liaccess to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is c
tobtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to i
organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained
through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access a
that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area
bnetworks and wide area networks.
rThe use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-e
controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal o
cnetworks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing
the network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are r

Discussion:  Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to 8

Defense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to authenticating users at the system
level (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application
level, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e.,
local, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options
appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as
additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.

Discussion: Out-of-band authentication refers to the use of two separate communication
paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an information system. The first path
(i.e., the in-band path) is used to identify and authenticate users or devices and is generally
the path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band path) is
used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example, a
user authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires
access and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently,
the server contacts the user via the user’s cell phone to verify that the requested action
originated from the user. The user may confirm the intended action to an individual on the
telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. Out-of-band authentication
can be used to mitigate actual or suspected “man-in the-middle” attacks. The conditions or
criteria for activation include suspicious activities, new threat indicators, elevated threat
levels, or the impact or classification level of information in requested transactions.
