oIA-9 SERVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
Assignment: organization-defined system services Control:  Uniquely identify and authenticate [0
and applications] before establishing communications with devices, users, or other services or 0
8applications.
Discussion:  Services that may require identification and authentication include web applications
Susing digital certificates or services or applications that query a database. Identification and
.authentication methods for system services and applications include information or code signing,
0provenance graphs, and electronic signatures that indicate the sources of services. Decisions
regarding the validity of identification and authentication claims can be made by services 3
separate from the services acting on those decisions. This can occur in distributed system
architectures. In such situations, the identification and authentication decisions (instead of actual
identifiers and authentication data) are provided to the services that need to act on those
decisions.
