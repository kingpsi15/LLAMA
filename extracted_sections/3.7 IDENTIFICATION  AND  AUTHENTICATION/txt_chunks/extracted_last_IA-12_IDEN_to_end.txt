3IA-12 IDENTITY PROOFING
Control:
a.Identity proof users that require accounts for logical access to systems based on appropriate
identity assurance level requirements as specified in applicable standards and guidelines;
b.Resolve user identities to a unique individual; and
c.Collect, validate, and verify identity evidence.
Discussion:  Identity proofing is the process of collecting, validating, and verifying a user’s
identity information for the purposes of establishing credentials for accessing a system. Identity
proofing is intended to mitigate threats to the registration of users and the establishment of

requirements.

Control Enhancements:
| (1) IDENTITY PROOFING  SUPERVISOR AUTHORIZATION
Require that the registration process to receive an account for logical access includes
supervisor or sponsor authorization.
Discussion:  Including supervisor or sponsor authorization as part of the registration process
hprovides an additional level of scrutiny to ensure that the user’s management chain is aware
of the account, the account is essential to carry out organizational missions and functions, p
band the user’s privileges are appropriate for the anticipated responsibilities and authorities
within the organization. a

laRequire evidence of individual identification be presented to the registration authority.
Discussion:  Identity evidence, such as documentary evidence or a combination of
documents and biometrics, reduces the likelihood of individuals using fraudulent
identification to establish an identity or at least increases the work factor of potential
adversaries. The forms of acceptable evidence are consistent with the risks to the systems, h
roles, and privileges associated with the user’s account.  g

|- 5(4) IDENTITY PROOFING  INPERSON VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION
Require that the validation and verification of identity evidence be conducted in person
before a designated registration authority.
Discussion:  In-person proofing reduces the likelihood of fraudulent credentials being issued
because it requires the physical presence of individuals, the presentation of physical identity
documents, and actual face-to-face interactions with designated registration authorities.
Related Controls:  None.

Selection: registration code; notice of proofingRequire that a [] be delivered through an
out-of-band channel to verify the users address (physical or digital) of record.
Discussion:  To make it more difficult for adversaries to pose as legitimate users during the
identity proofing process, organizations can use out-of-band methods to ensure that the
individual associated with an address of record is the same individual that participated in the
registration. Confirmation can take the form of a temporary enrollment code or a notice of
proofing. The delivery address for these artifacts is obtained from records and not self-
asserted by the user. The address can include a physical or digital address. A home address is
an example of a physical address. Email addresses and telephone numbers are examples of
digital addresses.

assurance level].
liDiscussion:  To limit unnecessary re-proofing of identities, particularly of non-PIV users, c
torganizations accept proofing conducted at a commensurate level of assurance by other i
agencies or organizations. Proofing is consistent with organizational security policy and the
identity assurance level appropriate for the system, application, or information accessed.a
Accepting externally-proofed identities is a fundamental component of managing federated
bidentities across agencies and organizations.
