Discussion:  Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, certificates,
0one-time password devices, and ID badges. Device authenticators include certificates and
5passwords. Initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial
5password). In contrast, the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria or
characteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver system components
with factory default authentication credentials (i.e., passwords) to allow for initial installation
and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable,
and present a significant risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be

stage of biometric authentication). Actions can be taken to safeguard individual authenticators,
including maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators with others, and
immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators. Authenticator management
includes issuing and revoking authenticators for temporary access when no longer needed.

:Discussion:  Password-based authentication applies to passwords regardless of whether they

:preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal security /
obenefits while decreasing usability. However, organizations may choose to establish certain
rules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length for long passwords) under r
certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement in IA-5(1)(h). Account recovery can 1
occur, for example, in situations when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected 6

Nused, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous
breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes T
context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof.

Discussion:  Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for individuals,
machines, and devices. For PKI solutions, status information for certification paths includes
certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, certificate
validation involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common
Policy Root trust anchor, which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing a local
cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system
availability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation information via
the network.

authenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery o

Discussion:  When individuals have accounts on multiple systems and use the same
authenticators such as passwords, there is the risk that a compromise of one account may
lead to the compromise of other accounts. Alternative approaches include having different
authenticators (passwords) on all systems, employing a single sign-on or federation
mechanism, or using some form of one-time passwords on all systems. Organizations can

is| (10) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT  DYNAMIC CREDENTIAL BINDING
aAssignment: Bind identities and authenticators dynamically using the following rules: [
organization-defined binding rules]. b
Discussion:  Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and the f
eauthenticator that is used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, binding is
festablished by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the system. For
example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator) a
is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the system. New
authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity and the authenticator to r
be implemented external to a system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity
and authenticator are bound together on the smartcard. Using these credentials, systems t
scan authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning the
didentity after authentication. In these situations, organizations can anticipate the dynamic
i.provisioning of identities. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with o
appropriate authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential.

5Assignment: organization-defined biometric quality biometric quality requirements [
5requirements ].
Discussion:  Unlike password-based authentication, which provides exact matches of user-
input passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does not provide exact
matches. Depending on the type of biometric and the type of collection mechanism, there is
likely to be some divergence from the presented biometric and the stored biometric that
serves as the basis for comparison. Matching performance is the rate at which a biometric
algorithm correctly results in a match for a genuine user and rejects other users. Biometric
performance requirements include the match rate, which reflects the accuracy of the
biometric matching algorithm used by a system.

obtain facial images with or without their knowledge, lifting from objects that someone has
touched (e.g., a latent fingerprint), or capturing a high-resolution image (e.g., an iris
pattern). Presentation attack detection technologies including liveness detection, can
mitigate the risk of these types of attacks by making it difficult to produce artifacts intended

Discussion:  For systems where static passwords are employed, it is often a challenge to
ensure that the passwords are suitably complex and that the same passwords are not
employed on multiple systems. A password manager is a solution to this problem as it
automatically generates and stores strong and different passwords for various accounts. A
potential risk of using password managers is that adversaries can target the collection of
