IA-7 CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE AUTHENTICATION 2
Control:  Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the I
requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
Pand guidelines for such authentication.
0Discussion:  Authentication mechanisms may be required within a cryptographic module to
authenticate an operator accessing the module and to verify that the operator is authorized to 3
assume the requested role and perform services within that role.
Related Controls:  AC-3, IA-5, SA-4, SC-12, SC-13.
