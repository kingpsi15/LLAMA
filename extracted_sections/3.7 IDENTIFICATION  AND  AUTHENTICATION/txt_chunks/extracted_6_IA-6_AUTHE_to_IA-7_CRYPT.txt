IA-6 AUTHENTICATION FEEDBACK
Control:  Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to is
protect the information from possible exploitation and use by unauthorized individuals.
laDiscussion:  Authentication feedback from systems does not provide information that would
allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of
esystems, such as desktops or notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (referred to as
oshoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems, such as mobile devices with
small displays, the threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood h
rof typographic input errors due to small keyboards. Thus, the means for obscuring authentication
feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authentication feedback includes displaying asterisks
when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time m
before obscuring it. h
