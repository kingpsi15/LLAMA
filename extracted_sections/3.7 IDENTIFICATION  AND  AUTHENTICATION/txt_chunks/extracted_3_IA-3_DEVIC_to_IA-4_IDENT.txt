aIA-3 DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
laAssignment: organization-defined devices and/or Control:  Uniquely identify and authenticate [
letypes of devicesSelection (one or more): local; remote; network] before establishing a []
econnection.
Discussion:  Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are
defined by type, device, or a combination of type and device. Organization-defined device types a
include devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information e
r(e.g., Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] o
addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of :
tElectrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP],
RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and
authenticate devices on local and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required
ostrength of authentication mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and mission
or business requirements. Because of the challenges of implementing device authentication on a /
large scale, organizations can restrict the application of the control to a limited number/type of .
devices based on mission or business needs. 2

bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based.
Discussion:  A local connection is a connection with a device that communicates without the
use of a network. A network connection is a connection with a device that communicates
through a network. A remote connection is a connection with a device that communicates
through an external network. Bidirectional authentication provides stronger protection to
validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.

(a)Where addresses are allocated dynamically, standardize dynamic address allocation
lease information and the lease duration assigned to devices in accordance with
Assignment: organization-defined lease information and lease duration[]; and
(b)Audit lease information when assigned to a device.
Discussion:  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an example of a means by
which clients can dynamically receive network address assignments.

| (4) DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION  DEVICE ATTESTATION
Assignment: Handle device identification and authentication based on attestation by [T
organization-defined configuration management processi]. s
uDiscussion:  Device attestation refers to the identification and authentication of a device
libased on its configuration and known operating state. Device attestation can be determined c
via a cryptographic hash of the device. If device attestation is the means of identification and i
authentication, then it is important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a
aconfiguration management process such that the patches and updates are done securely
and do not disrupt identification and authentication to other devices. i
