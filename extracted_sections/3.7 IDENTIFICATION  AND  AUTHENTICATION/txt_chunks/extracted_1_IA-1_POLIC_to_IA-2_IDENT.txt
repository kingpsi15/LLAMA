/Discussion:  Identification and authentication policy and procedures address the controls in the d
iIA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy .
gis an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures
0contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy
programs collaborate on the development of identification and authentication policy and 0
8procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
Ipreferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and
procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be .
represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can
0be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for
systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can 5
be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be 5
documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events
that may precipitate an update to identification and authentication policy and procedures
include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable
laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply
restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.
