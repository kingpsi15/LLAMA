Discussion:  Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, Internet 0
8Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. The management of individual
identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the I
usernames of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account

reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, 5

messaging. Prohibiting the use of systems account identifiers that are the same as some
public identifier, such as the individual identifier section of an electronic mail address, makes
it more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers. Prohibiting account identifiers as
public identifiers without the implementation of other supporting controls only complicates
guessing of identifiers. Additional protections are required for authenticators and credentials
to protect the account.

bAssignment: Manage individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as [
organization-defined characteristic identifying individual status ].a
Discussion:  Characteristics that identify the status of individuals include contractors, foreign n
nationals, and non-organizational users. Identifying the status of individuals by these
characteristics provides additional information about the people with whom organizational a
lapersonnel are communicating. For example, it might be useful for a government employee
leto know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor.

rAssignment: organization-Manage individual identifiers dynamically in accordance with [g
defined dynamic identifier policy ].f
Discussion:  In contrast to conventional approaches to identification that presume static
accounts for preregistered users, many distributed systems establish identifiers at runtime
for entities that were previously unknown. When identifiers are established at runtime for s
previously unknown entities, organizations can anticipate and provision for the dynamic d
i.establishment of identifiers. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with
gappropriate authorities to validate credentials and related identifiers are essential.

a subscriber discourages subscriber activity tracking and profiling beyond the operational
