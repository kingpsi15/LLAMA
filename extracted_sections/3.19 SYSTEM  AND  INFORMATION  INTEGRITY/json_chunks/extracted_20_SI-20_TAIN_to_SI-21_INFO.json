In addition, insider attacks and erroneous user procedures can remove\ninformation from the system that is in violation of the organizational policies. Tainting\napproaches can range from passive to active. A passive tainting approach can be as simple as\nadding false email names and addresses to an internal database. If the organization receives\nemail at one of the false email addresses, it knows that the database has been compromised.\nMoreover, the organization knows that the email was sent by an unauthorized entity, so any\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 360\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\npackets it includes potentially contain malicious code, and that the unauthorized entity may have\npotentially obtained a copy of the database.
