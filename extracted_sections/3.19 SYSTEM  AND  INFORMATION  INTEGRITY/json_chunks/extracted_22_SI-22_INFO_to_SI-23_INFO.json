Corruption, fabrication, modification, or deletion of that information could impact the T\nability of the service function to properly carry out its intended actions. By having multiple\n8sources of input, the service or function can continue operation if one source is corrupted or no\nlonger available. It is possible that the alternative sources of information may be less precise or -\nless accurate than the primary source of information. But having such sub-optimal information\nsources may still provide a sufficient level of quality that the essential service or function can be\ncarried out, even in a degraded or debilitated manner.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [SP 800-160-2]."
