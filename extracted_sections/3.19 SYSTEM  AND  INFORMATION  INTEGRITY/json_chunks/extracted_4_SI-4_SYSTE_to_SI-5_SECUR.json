External monitoring\nhincludes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal\nmonitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations g\nmonitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects f\nmsuch as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives\nhguide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved\nthrough a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems,\n/malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and\ninetwork monitoring software. .\n/Depending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices 1\n.may impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations\n2across a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput\nmanagement is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an N\nestablished organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices\nSinclude selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical\n.applications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated 8\n0. The information collected is a function of the organizational with controls SC-7 and AC-17\n3monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of\ntransactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP\nproxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and\nincident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those\nprograms. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system\nAC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-monitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g.,\n13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-\n43b). Adjustments to levels of system monitoring are based on law enforcement information,\nintelligence information, or other sources of information. The legality of system monitoring\nactivities is based on applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,\nstandards, and guidelines.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 337\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-2, AU-6, AU-7, AU-9, AU-12, AU-13, AU-14,\nCA-7, CM-3, CM-6, CM-8, CM-11, IA-10, IR-4, MA-3, MA-4, PL-9, PM-12, RA-5, RA-10, SC-5, SC-7,\nSC-18, SC-26, SC-31, SC-35, SC-36, SC-37, SC-43, SI-3, SI-6, SI-7, SR-9, SR-10.\nControl Enhancements:\n|- (1) SYSTEM MONITORING  SYSTEMWIDE INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM\nConnect and configure individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion\ndetection system.\nDiscussion:  Linking individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion\ndetection system provides additional coverage and effective detection capabilities.

The sources for organization-generated alerts are\nbfocused on other entities such as suspicious activity reports and reports on potential insider\nthreats. In contrast to alerts generated by the organization, alerts generated by the system f\nSI-4(5) focus on information sources that are internal to the systems, such as audit in e\nrecords. f\naRelated Controls:  None.\n| (13) SYSTEM MONITORING  ANALYZE TRAFFIC AND EVENT PATTERNSf\n(a)Analyze communications traffic and event patterns for the system;\nt(b)Develop profiles representing common traffic and event patterns; and  t\n/(c)Use the traffic and event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices.\nDiscussion:  Identifying and understanding common communications traffic and event i.\npatterns help organizations provide useful information to system monitoring devices to g\nmore effectively identify suspicious or anomalous traffic and events when they occur.

Organizations\nproactively search for unauthorized wireless connections, including the conduct of thorough\nscans for unauthorized wireless access points. Wireless scans are not limited to those areas\nwithin facilities containing systems but also include areas outside of facilities to verify that\nunauthorized wireless access points are not connected to organizational systems.\nRelated Controls:  AC-18, IA-3.\n| (15) SYSTEM MONITORING  WIRELESS TO WIRELINE COMMUNICATIONS\nEmploy an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications traffic as the\ntraffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 340\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  Wireless networks are inherently less secure than wired networks. For example,\nwireless networks are more susceptible to eavesdroppers or traffic analysis than wireline\nnetworks. When wireless to wireline communications exist, the wireless network could\nbecome a port of entry into the wired network. Given the greater facility of unauthorized\nnetwork access via wireless access points compared to unauthorized wired network access\nfrom within the physical boundaries of the system, additional monitoring of transitioning\ntraffic between wireless and wired networks may be necessary to detect malicious activities.\nEmploying intrusion detection systems to monitor wireless communications traffic helps to\nensure that the traffic does not contain malicious code prior to transitioning to the wireline\nnetwork.\nRelated Controls:  AC-18.\n| (16) SYSTEM MONITORING  CORRELATE MONITORING INFORMATION\nhCorrelate information from monitoring tools and mechanisms employed throughout the\nsystem. p\nDiscussion:  Correlating information from different system monitoring tools and mechanisms lic\ncan provide a more comprehensive view of system activity. Correlating system monitoring t\nntools and mechanisms that typically work in isolation\u2014including malicious code protection\nsoftware, host monitoring, and network monitoring\u2014can provide an organization-wide\nmonitoring view and may reveal otherwise unseen attack patterns. Understanding the a\ncapabilities and limitations of diverse monitoring tools and mechanisms and how to\nmaximize the use of information generated by those tools and mechanisms can help\neorganizations develop, operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs. The correlation\noof monitoring information is especially important during the transition from older to newer\ntechnologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). h\ngRelated Controls:  AU-6.\no| (17) SYSTEM MONITORING  INTEGRATED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS m\nhCorrelate information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain activities to\nachieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness. s\ndDiscussion:  Correlating monitoring information from a more diverse set of information\ni.sources helps to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated situational awareness o\nfrom a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring activities enhances the\ncapability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated attacks and investigate the\nSI-4(16), which methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In contrast to\ncorrelates the various cyber monitoring information, integrated situational awareness is /\nSintended to correlate monitoring beyond the cyber domain. Correlation of monitoring\n.information from multiple activities may help reveal attacks on organizations that are S\noperating across multiple attack vectors. .\n0Related Controls:  AU-16, PE-6, SR-2, SR-4, SR-6.\nr| (18) 5SYSTEM MONITORING  ANALYZE TRAFFIC AND COVERT EXFILTRATION\nAnalyze outbound communications traffic at external interfaces to the system and at the\nAssignment: following interior points to detect covert exfiltration of information: [\norganization-defined interior points within the system].\nDiscussion:  Organization-defined interior points include subnetworks and subsystems.\nCovert means that can be used to exfiltrate information include steganography.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (19) SYSTEM MONITORING  RISK FOR INDIVIDUALS\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 341\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAssignment: organization-defined additional monitoringImplement [] of individuals who\nAssignment: organization-defined sourceshave been identified by [] as posing an increased\nlevel of risk.\nDiscussion:  Indications of increased risk from individuals can be obtained from different\nsources, including personnel records, intelligence agencies, law enforcement organizations,\nand other sources.

IOCs for network traffic include Universal Resource Locator or protocol\nelements that indicate malicious code command and control servers. The rapid distribution\nand adoption of IOCs can improve information security by reducing the time that systems\nThreat indicators, signatures, and organizations are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack.\ntactics, techniques, procedures, and other indicators of compromise may be available via\ngovernment and non-government cooperatives, including the Forum of Incident Response\nTand Security Teams, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, the Defense\nisIndustrial Base Cybersecurity Information Sharing Program, and the CERT Coordination\nuCenter.\nlicRelated Controls:  AC-18.\nn| (25) SYSTEM MONITORING  OPTIMIZE NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS\naProvide visibility into network traffic at external and key internal system interfaces to\noptimize the effectiveness of monitoring devices.   i\nDiscussion:  Encrypted traffic, asymmetric routing architectures, capacity and latency le\nlimitations, and transitioning from older to newer technologies (e.g., IPv4 to IPv6 network r\nprotocol transition) may result in blind spots for organizations when analyzing network\ntraffic.
