Failure s\nrates reflect installation-specific consideration rather than the industry-average. Organizations u\nldefine the criteria for the substitution of system components based on the MTTF value with ic\ntconsideration for the potential harm from component failures. The transfer of responsibilities i\nbetween active and standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or\nsecurity capabilities. The preservation of system state variables is also critical to help ensure a a\nasuccessful transfer process. Standby components remain available at all times except for\nbmaintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.\nrRelated Controls:  CP-2, CP-10, CP-13, MA-2, MA-6, SA-8, SC-6. e\nControl Enhancements: f\n| (1) PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION  TRANSFERRING COMPONENT RESPONSIBILITIESr\nTake system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to f\nmAssignment: organization-defined fraction or substitute components no later than [\npercentageh] of mean time to failure.\nsDiscussion:  Transferring primary system component responsibilities to other substitute\ndcomponents prior to primary component failure is important to reduce the risk of degraded\ni.or debilitated mission or business functions. Making such transfers based on a percentage of\nmean time to failure allows organizations to be proactive based on their risk tolerance.\n0However, the premature replacement of system components can result in the increased cost\n0of system operations.\n/Related Controls:  None.
