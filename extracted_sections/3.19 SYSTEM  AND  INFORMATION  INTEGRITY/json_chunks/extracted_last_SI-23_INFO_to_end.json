Such\nactions will increase the adversary\u2019s work factor to capture and exfiltrate the desired information\nand, in so doing, increase the probability of detection. The fragmentation of information impacts\nthe organization\u2019s ability to access the information in a timely manner. The extent of the\nfragmentation is dictated by the impact or classification level (and value) of the information,\nthreat intelligence information received, and whether data tainting is used (i.e., data tainting-\nderived information about the exfiltration of some information could result in the fragmentation h\nof the remaining information).\nlRelated Controls:  None. ic\noControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [SP 800-160-2].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 362"
