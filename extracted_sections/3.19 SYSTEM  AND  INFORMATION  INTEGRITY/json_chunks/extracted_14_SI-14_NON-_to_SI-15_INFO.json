By r\nimplementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components, organizations can\nprovide a trusted, known state computing resource for a specific time period that does not give t\nsadversaries sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems or operating\ndenvironments. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat with regard to capability, intent,\ni.and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will o\nbe successful. Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using\nprotected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence\n0increases the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach organizational\nsystems. /\nNon-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, periodically reimaging T\ncomponents, or using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can\n8be implemented by using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new\ninstances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of -\nperiodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require organizations to\nfirst determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that\nmay often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components and services\noccurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not\nwith such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components and\nservices may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum\nwindows of vulnerabilities.\n.
