The information life cycle includes the creation, collection, r\n1use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal of personally\nidentifiable information. Personally identifiable information quality operations include editing 6\nand validating addresses as they are collected or entered into systems using automated address\nNverification look-up application programming interfaces. Checking personally identifiable\ninformation quality includes the tracking of updates or changes to data over time, which enables T\norganizations to know how and what personally identifiable information was changed should\n8erroneous information be identified. The measures taken to protect personally identifiable\ninformation quality are based on the nature and context of the personally identifiable -\ninformation, how it is to be used, how it was obtained, and the potential de-identification\nmethods employed. The measures taken to validate the accuracy of personally identifiable\ninformation used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals\ncovered under federal programs may be more comprehensive than the measures used to\nvalidate personally identifiable information used for less sensitive purposes.\nRelated Controls:  PM-22, PM-24, PT-2, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION QUALITY OPERATIONS  AUTOMATION SUPPORT\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 356\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nCorrect or deletepersonally identifiable information that is inaccurate or outdated,\nAssignment: incorrectly determined regarding impact, or incorrectly de-identified using [\norganization-defined automated mechanisms].\nDiscussion:  The use of automated mechanisms to improve data quality may inadvertently\ncreate privacy risks. Automated tools may connect to external or otherwise unrelated\nsystems, and the matching of records between these systems may create linkages with\nunintended consequences. Organizations assess and document these risks in their privacy\nimpact assessments and make determinations that are in alignment with their privacy\nprogram plans.\nAs data is obtained and used across the information life cycle, it is important to confirm the\naccuracy and relevance of personally identifiable information. Automated mechanisms can\naugment existing data quality processes and procedures and enable an organization to\nbetter identify and manage personally identifiable information in large-scale systems. For T\niexample, automated tools can greatly improve efforts to consistently normalize data or s\nidentify malformed data. Automated tools can also be used to improve the auditing of data u\nland detect errors that may incorrectly alter personally identifiable information or incorrectly ic\ntassociate such information with the wrong individual. Automated capabilities backstop\nprocesses and procedures at-scale and enable more fine-grained detection and correction of\ndata quality errors. a\n.Related Controls:  PM-18, RA-8 i\nle| (2) PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION QUALITY OPERATIONS  DATA TAGS\neEmploy data tags to automate the correction or deletion of personally identifiable\ninformation across the information life cycle within organizational systems. f\naDiscussion:  Data tagging personally identifiable information includes tags that note\nprocessing permissions, authority to process, de-identification, impact level, information life e\nrcycle stage, and retention or last updated dates. Employing data tags for personally o\nidentifiable information can support the use of automation tools to correct or delete :\ntrelevant personally identifiable information.\n:Related Controls:  AC-3, AC-16,  SC-16. /\ni.| (3) PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION QUALITY OPERATIONS  COLLECTIONo\n/Collect personally identifiable information directly from the individual. 1\n6Discussion:  Individuals or their designated representatives can be sources of correct\npersonally identifiable information. Organizations consider contextual factors that may 8\nincentivize individuals to provide correct data versus false data. Additional steps may be\nTnecessary to validate collected information based on the nature and context of the\npersonally identifiable information, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. The P\n8measures taken to validate the accuracy of personally identifiable information used to make\ndeterminations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals under federal programs -\nmay be more comprehensive than the measures taken to validate less sensitive personally r\nidentifiable information.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|  (4) PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATIONQUALITY OPERATIONSINDIVIDUAL REQUESTS\nCorrect or delete personally identifiable information upon request by individuals or their\ndesignated representatives.\nDiscussion:  Inaccurate personally identifiable information maintained by organizations may\ncause problems for individuals, especially in those business functions where inaccurate\ninformation may result in inappropriate decisions or the denial of benefits and services to\nindividuals.
