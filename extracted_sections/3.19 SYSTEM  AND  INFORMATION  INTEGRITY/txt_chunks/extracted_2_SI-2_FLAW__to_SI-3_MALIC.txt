SI-2 FLAW REMEDIATION
Control:
a.Identify, report, and correct system flaws;
b.Test software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and
potential side effects before installation;
Assignment: organization-c.Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within [
defined time period] of the release of the updates; and
d.Incorporate flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process.
Discussion:  The need to remediate system flaws applies to all types of software and firmware.
Organizations identify systems affected by software flaws, including potential vulnerabilities
hresulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated organizational personnel
with information security and privacy responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, p
bservice packs, and malicious code signatures. Organizations also address flaws discovered during
assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. By a
incorporating flaw remediation into configuration management processes, required remediation
isactions can be tracked and verified.
aOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may
vary based on a variety of risk factors, including the security category of the system, the criticality b
of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw), the organizational
risk tolerance, the mission supported by the system, or the threat environment. Some types of e
flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the type f
hof testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and the
gtypes of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may
fdetermine that the testing of software or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, such as r
when implementing simple malicious code signature updates. In testing decisions, organizations
consider whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized
sources with appropriate digital signatures. s

organization-defined benchmarks].
Discussion:  Organizations determine the time it takes on average to correct system flaws
after such flaws have been identified and subsequently establish organizational benchmarks

uDiscussion:  Due to system integrity and availability concerns, organizations consider the
limethodology used to carry out automatic updates. Organizations balance the need to c
ensure that the updates are installed as soon as possible with the need to maintain i
configuration management and control with any mission or operational impacts that
aautomatic updates might impose.

Discussion:  Previous versions of software or firmware components that are not removed
efrom the system after updates have been installed may be exploited by adversaries. Some
