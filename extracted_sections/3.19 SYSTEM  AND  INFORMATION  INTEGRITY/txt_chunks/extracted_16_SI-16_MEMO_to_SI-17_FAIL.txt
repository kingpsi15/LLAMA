SI-16 MEMORY PROTECTION
Control:  Implement the following controls to protect the system memory from unauthorized
Assignment: organization-defined controlscode execution: [].
Discussion:  Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non-executable
regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Controls employed to protect
memory include data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data
