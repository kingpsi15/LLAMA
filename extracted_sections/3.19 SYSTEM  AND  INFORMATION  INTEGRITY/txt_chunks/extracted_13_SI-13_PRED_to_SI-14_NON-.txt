SI-13 PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION
Control:
a.Determine mean time to failure (MTTF) for the following system components in specific
Assignment: organization-defined system componentsenvironments of operation: []; and
b.Provide substitute system components and a means to exchange active and standby
Assignment: organization-defined components in accordance with the following criteria: [
MTTF substitution criteria].
Discussion:  While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, predictable failure prevention is intended T
ito address potential failures of system components that provide security capabilities. Failure s
rates reflect installation-specific consideration rather than the industry-average. Organizations u
ldefine the criteria for the substitution of system components based on the MTTF value with ic
tconsideration for the potential harm from component failures. The transfer of responsibilities i
between active and standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or
security capabilities. The preservation of system state variables is also critical to help ensure a a
asuccessful transfer process. Standby components remain available at all times except for
bmaintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.

Take system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to f
mAssignment: organization-defined fraction or substitute components no later than [
percentageh] of mean time to failure.
sDiscussion:  Transferring primary system component responsibilities to other substitute
dcomponents prior to primary component failure is important to reduce the risk of degraded
i.or debilitated mission or business functions. Making such transfers based on a percentage of
mean time to failure allows organizations to be proactive based on their risk tolerance.

Discussion:  For example, if the MTTF for a system component is 100 days and the MTTF
percentage defined by the organization is 90 percent, themanual transfer would occur after
90 days.

Discussion:  Failover refers to the automatic switchover to an alternate system upon the
failure of the primary system. Failover capability includes incorporating mirrored system
operations at alternate processing sites or periodic data mirroring at regular intervals
defined by the recovery time periods of organizations. b
