6Discussion:  Transitional states for systems include system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort.
System notifications include hardware indicator lights, electronic alerts to system administrators,
and messages to local computer consoles. In contrast to security function verification, privacy
function verification ensures that privacy functions operate as expected and are approved by the T
senior agency official for privacy or that privacy attributes are applied or used as expected.

Discussion:  The use of automated mechanisms to support the management of distributed
function testing helps to ensure the integrity, timeliness, completeness, and efficacy of such
testing.

| (3) SECURITY AND PRIVACY FUNCTION VERIFICATION  REPORT VERIFICATION RESULTS
Assignment: Report the results of security and privacy function verification to [
organization-defined personnel or roles].
Discussion:  Organizational personnel with potential interest in the results of the verification
of security and privacy functions include systems security officers, senior agency information
security officers, and senior agency officials for privacy.
