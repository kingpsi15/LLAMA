SI-10  INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION .
8Assignment: organization-Control:  Check the validity of the following information inputs: [
defined information inputs to the system]. -
5Discussion:  Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs—including character set,
length, numerical range, and acceptable values—verifies that inputs match specified definitions
for format and content. For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between
1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of “387,” “abc,” or
“%K%” are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to
vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined
protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between
software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured
data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-
supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages,
then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data

to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component
that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the
data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content
from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and
correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

Control Enhancements:
| (1) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION  MANUAL OVERRIDE CAPABILITY
(a)Provide a manual override capability for input validation ofthe following information
Assignment: organization-defined inputs defined in the base control (SI-10)inputs: [];
Assignment: organization-(b)Restrict the use of the manual override capability to only [
hdefined authorized individuals]; and
(c)Audit the use of the manual override capability.
liDiscussion:  In certain situations, such as during events that are defined in contingency plans, c
ta manual override capability for input validation may be needed. Manual overrides are used i
only in limited circumstances and with the inputs defined by the organization.

Assignment: organization-defined time Review and resolve input validation errors within [f
eperiod].
Discussion:  Resolution of input validation errors includes correcting systemic causes of c
aerrors and resubmitting transactions with corrected input. Input validation errors are those

| (3) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION  PREDICTABLE BEHAVIORt
:Verify that the system behaves in a predictable and documented manner when invalid
oinputs are received.
rDiscussion:  A common vulnerability in organizational systems is unpredictable behavior
when invalid inputs are received. Verification of system predictability helps ensure that the
6system behaves as expected when invalid inputs are received. This occurs by specifying
system responses that allow the system to transition to known states without adverse, 8
unintended side effects. The invalid inputs are those related to the information inputs
TSI-10). defined by the organization in the base control (
Related Controls:  None.
| (4) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION  TIMING INTERACTIONS-
rAccount for timing interactions among system components in determining appropriate
responses for invalid inputs.
Discussion:  In addressing invalid system inputs received across protocol interfaces, timing
interactions become relevant, where one protocol needs to consider the impact of the error
response on other protocols in the protocol stack. For example, 802.11 standard wireless
network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control Protocols (TCP) when
packets are dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP assumes packet losses
are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically dropped due to noise
or collisions on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes the wrong action in
response to a collision event. Adversaries may be able to use what appear to be acceptable
individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse effects through suitable

|(5) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION  RESTRICT INPUTS TO TRUSTED SOURCES AND APPROVED
FORMATS
Assignment: organization-defined trusted Restrict the use of information inputs to [
sourcesAssignment: organization-defined formats] and/or [].
Discussion:  Restricting the use of inputs to trusted sources and in trusted formats applies
the concept of authorized or permitted software to information inputs. Specifying known
trusted sources for information inputs and acceptable formats for such inputs can reduce
the probability of malicious activity. The information inputs are those defined by the

| (6) INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION  INJECTION PREVENTIONlic
tPrevent untrusted data injections. i
Discussion: Untrusted data injections may be prevented using a parameterized interface or is
aoutput escaping (output encoding). Parameterized interfaces separate data from code so
that injections of malicious or unintended data cannot change the semantics of commands i
being sent. Output escaping uses specified characters to inform the interpreter’s parser
fwhether data is trusted. Prevention of untrusted data injections are with respect to the
