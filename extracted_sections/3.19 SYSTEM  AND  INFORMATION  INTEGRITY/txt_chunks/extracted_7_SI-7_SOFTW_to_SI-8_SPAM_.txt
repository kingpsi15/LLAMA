cDiscussion:  Unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information can occur due to
errors or malicious activity. Software includes operating systems (with key internal components, r
such as kernels or drivers), middleware, and applications. Firmware interfaces include Unified
Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). Information includes  m
:personally identifiable information and metadata that contains security and privacy attributes
tassociated with information. Integrity-checking mechanisms—including parity checks, cyclical p
:redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes, and associated tools—can automatically monitor the /
ointegrity of systems and hosted applications.

tor a persistent malicious code presence. These situations can occur if the firmware is p
:corrupted or if the malicious code is embedded within the firmware. System components /
ocan protect the integrity of boot firmware in organizational systems by verifying the integrity

Discussion:  Placing a time limit on process execution without supervision is intended to
apply to processes for which typical or normal execution periods can be determined and
esituations in which organizations exceed such periods. Supervision includes timers on

,,|- (17) SOFTWARE FIRMWARE AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY  RUNTIME APPLICATION SELFPROTECTION  m
hAssignment: organization-defined controlsImplement [] for application self-protection at
runtime. s
dDiscussion:  Runtime application self-protection employs runtime instrumentation to detect
i.and block the exploitation of software vulnerabilities by taking advantage of information o
from the software in execution. Runtime exploit prevention differs from traditional
perimeter-based protections such as guards and firewalls which can only detect and block
attacks by using network information without contextual awareness. Runtime application
self-protection technology can reduce the susceptibility of software to attacks by monitoring /
Sits inputs and blocking those inputs that could allow attacks. It can also help protect the
.runtime environment from unwanted changes and tampering. When a threat is detected, S
runtime application self-protection technology can prevent exploitation and take other .
actions (e.g., sending a warning message to the user, terminating the user's session, 0
terminating the application, or sending an alert to organizational personnel). Runtime
5application self-protection solutions can be deployed in either a monitor or protection
mode.
