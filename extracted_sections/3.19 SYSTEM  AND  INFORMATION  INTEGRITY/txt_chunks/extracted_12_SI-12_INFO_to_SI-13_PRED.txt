Discussion:  Information management and retention requirements cover the full life cycle of
information, in some cases extending beyond system disposal. Information to be retained may
also include policies, procedures, plans, reports, data output from control implementation, and
other types of administrative information. The National Archives and Records Administration

Discussion:  Organizations can minimize both security and privacy risks by disposing of
information when it is no longer needed. The disposal or destruction of information applies
to originals as well as copies and archived records, including system logs that may contain
personally identifiable information.
