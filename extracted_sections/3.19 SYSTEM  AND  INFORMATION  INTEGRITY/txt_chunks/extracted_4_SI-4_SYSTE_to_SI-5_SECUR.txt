Discussion:  System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring
hincludes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal
monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations g
monitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects f
msuch as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives
hguide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved
through a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems,
/malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and
inetwork monitoring software. .
/Depending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices 1
.may impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations
2across a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput
management is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an N
established organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices
Sinclude selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical
.applications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated 8
0. The information collected is a function of the organizational with controls SC-7 and AC-17
3monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of
transactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP
proxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and
incident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those
programs. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system
AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-monitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g.,
13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-
43b). Adjustments to levels of system monitoring are based on law enforcement information,
intelligence information, or other sources of information. The legality of system monitoring
activities is based on applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
standards, and guidelines.

Discussion:  Wireless signals may radiate beyond organizational facilities. Organizations
proactively search for unauthorized wireless connections, including the conduct of thorough
scans for unauthorized wireless access points. Wireless scans are not limited to those areas
within facilities containing systems but also include areas outside of facilities to verify that
unauthorized wireless access points are not connected to organizational systems.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________
Discussion:  Wireless networks are inherently less secure than wired networks. For example,
wireless networks are more susceptible to eavesdroppers or traffic analysis than wireline
networks. When wireless to wireline communications exist, the wireless network could
become a port of entry into the wired network. Given the greater facility of unauthorized
network access via wireless access points compared to unauthorized wired network access
from within the physical boundaries of the system, additional monitoring of transitioning
traffic between wireless and wired networks may be necessary to detect malicious activities.
Employing intrusion detection systems to monitor wireless communications traffic helps to
ensure that the traffic does not contain malicious code prior to transitioning to the wireline
network.

hCorrelate information from monitoring tools and mechanisms employed throughout the
system. p
Discussion:  Correlating information from different system monitoring tools and mechanisms lic
can provide a more comprehensive view of system activity. Correlating system monitoring t
ntools and mechanisms that typically work in isolation—including malicious code protection
software, host monitoring, and network monitoring—can provide an organization-wide
monitoring view and may reveal otherwise unseen attack patterns. Understanding the a
capabilities and limitations of diverse monitoring tools and mechanisms and how to
maximize the use of information generated by those tools and mechanisms can help
eorganizations develop, operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs. The correlation
oof monitoring information is especially important during the transition from older to newer
technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). h

i.sources helps to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated situational awareness o
from a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring activities enhances the
capability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated attacks and investigate the
SI-4(16), which methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In contrast to
