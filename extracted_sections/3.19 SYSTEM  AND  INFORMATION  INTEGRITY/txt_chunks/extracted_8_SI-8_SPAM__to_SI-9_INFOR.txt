a.Employ spam protection mechanisms at system entry and exit points to detect and act on
unsolicited messages; and
b.Update spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in accordance with
organizational configuration management policy and procedures.
Discussion:  System entry and exit points include firewalls, remote-access servers, electronic mail
servers, web servers, proxy servers, workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices.
Spam can be transported by different means, including email, email attachments, and web
accesses. Spam protection mechanisms include signature definitions.
Related Controls:  PL-9, SC-5, SC-7, SC-38, SI-3, SI-4.
Control Enhancements:
|  T(1) SPAM PROTECTION CENTRAL MANAGEMENT
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PL-9.]
|  l(2) SPAM PROTECTION  AUTOMATIC UPDATESic
tAssignment: organization-defined Automatically update spam protection mechanisms [i
frequency].
Discussion:  Using automated mechanisms to update spam protection mechanisms helps to v
iensure that updates occur on a regular basis and provide the latest content and protection la
capabilities. le
Related Controls:  None. e
f| (3) SPAM PROTECTION CONTINUOUS LEARNING CAPABILITY
Implement spam protection mechanisms with a learning capability to more effectively
eidentify legitimate communications traffic.
Discussion:  Learning mechanisms include Bayesian filters that respond to user inputs that  m
identify specific traffic as spam or legitimate by updating algorithm parameters and thereby
pmore accurately separating types of traffic.
/Related Controls:  None. d
