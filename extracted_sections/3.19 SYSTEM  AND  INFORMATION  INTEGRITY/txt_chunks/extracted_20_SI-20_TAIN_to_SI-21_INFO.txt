SI-20 TAINTING
5Control:  Embed data or capabilities inthe following systems or system components to
determine if organizational data has been exfiltrated or improperly removed from the

Discussion:  Many cyber-attacks target organizational information, or information that the
organization holds on behalf of other entities (e.g., personally identifiable information), and
exfiltrate that data. In addition, insider attacks and erroneous user procedures can remove
information from the system that is in violation of the organizational policies. Tainting
approaches can range from passive to active. A passive tainting approach can be as simple as
adding false email names and addresses to an internal database. If the organization receives
email at one of the false email addresses, it knows that the database has been compromised.
Moreover, the organization knows that the email was sent by an unauthorized entity, so any

packets it includes potentially contain malicious code, and that the unauthorized entity may have
potentially obtained a copy of the database. Another tainting approach can include embedding
false data or steganographic data in files to enable the data to be found via open-source analysis.
Finally, an active tainting approach can include embedding software in the data that is able to
“call home,” thereby alerting the organization to its “capture,” and possibly its location, and the
path by which it was exfiltrated or removed.
