mDiscussion:  De-identification is the general term for the process of removing the association
hbetween a set of identifying data and the data subject. Many datasets contain information about
individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social s
/security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records. Datasets d
imay also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, .
geducational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable information is
0removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or no longer)
necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example, if the dataset is only 0

0Re-identification is a residual risk with de-identified data. Re-identification attacks can vary,
including combining new datasets or other improvements in data analytics. Maintaining 5
awareness of potential attacks and evaluating for the effectiveness of the de-identification over 5
time support the management of this residual risk.

information.

data elements that contain the personally identifiable information. For example, if an
organization does not intend to use the social security number of an applicant, then
application forms do not ask for a social security number.
Related Controls:  None.
-| (2) DEIDENTIFICATION  ARCHIVING
Prohibit archiving of personally identifiable information elements if those elements in a
dataset will not be needed after the dataset is archived.
Discussion:  Datasets can be archived for many reasons. The envisioned purposes for the
archived dataset are specified, and if personally identifiable information elements are not
required, the elements are not archived. For example, social security numbers may have
been collected for record linkage, but the archived dataset may include the required
elements from the linked records. In this case, it is not necessary to archive the social
security numbers. is

n Removepersonally identifiable information elements from a dataset prior to its release if
those elements in the dataset do not need to be part of the data release.
Discussion:  Prior to releasing a dataset, a data custodian considers the intended uses of the i
bdataset and determines if it is necessary to release personally identifiable information. If the
personally identifiable information is not necessary, the information can be removed using f
ede-identification techniques.

f IDENTIFIERSr
Remove, mask, encrypt, hash, or replace direct identifiers in a dataset. :
tDiscussion:  There are many possible processes for removing direct identifiers from a p
:dataset. Columns in a dataset that contain a direct identifier can be removed. In masking, /
othe direct identifier is transformed into a repeating character, such as XXXXXX or 999999.
Identifiers can be encrypted or hashed so that the linked records remain linked. In the case r
1of encryption or hashing, algorithms are employed that require the use of a key, including
6the Advanced Encryption Standard or a Hash-based Message Authentication Code.
Implementations may use the same key for all identifiers or use a different key for each
identifier. Using a different key for each identifier provides a higher degree of security and
privacy. Identifiers can alternatively be replaced with a keyword, including transforming T
“George Washington” to “PATIENT” or replacing it with a surrogate value, such as
8transforming “George Washington” to “Abraham Polk.”

-| (5)  DEIDENTIFICATION  STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE CONTROL
Manipulate numerical data, contingency tables, and statistical findings so that no
individual or organization is identifiable in the results of the analysis.
Discussion:  Many types of statistical analyses can result in the disclosure of information
about individuals even if only summary information is provided. For example, if a school that
publishes a monthly table with the number of minority students enrolled, reports that it has
10-19 such students in January, and subsequently reports that it has 20-29 such students in
March, then it can be inferred that the student who enrolled in February was a minority.

-| (6) DEIDENTIFICATION  DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY
Prevent disclosure of personally identifiable information by adding non-deterministic
noise to the results of mathematical operations before the results are reported.
Discussion:  The mathematical definition for differential privacy holds that the result of a
dataset analysis should be approximately the same before and after the addition or removal
of a single data record (which is assumed to be the data from a single individual). In its most
basic form, differential privacy applies only to online query systems. However, it can also be
used to produce machine-learning statistical classifiers and synthetic data. Differential
privacy comes at the cost of decreased accuracy of results, forcing organizations to quantify
the trade-off between privacy protection and the overall accuracy, usefulness, and utility of
the de-identified dataset. Non-deterministic noise can include adding small, random values
to the results of mathematical operations in dataset analysis.

iDiscussion:  Algorithms that appear to remove personally identifiable information from a s
dataset may in fact leave information that is personally identifiable or data that is re-v
iidentifiable. Software that is claimed to implement a validated algorithm may contain bugs la
or implement a different algorithm. Software may de-identify one type of data, such as le
integers, but not de-identify another type of data, such as floating point numbers. For these r
reasons, de-identification is performed using algorithms and software that are validated.

-| (8) DEIDENTIFICATION  MOTIVATED INTRUDERe
oPerform a motivated intruder test on the de-identified dataset to determine if the
:identified data remains or if the de-identified data can be re-identified.
pDiscussion:  A motivated intruder test is a test in which an individual or group takes a data
/release and specified resources and attempts to re-identify one or more individuals in the /
o computational de-identified dataset. Such tests specify the amount of inside knowledge,i.
rresources, financial resources, data, and skills that intruders possess to conduct the tests. A
motivated intruder test can determine if the de-identification is insufficient. It can also be a
useful diagnostic tool to assess if de-identification is likely to be sufficient. However, the test
alone cannot prove that de-identification is sufficient. 8
