SI-14 NON-PERSISTENCE
lAssignment: organization-defined system components and eControl:  Implement non-persistent [
rservicesSelection (one or more): upon end of ] that are initiated in a known state and terminated [e
session of use; periodically at Assignment: organization-defined frequency[]]. o
Discussion:  Implementation of non-persistent components and services mitigates risk from
gadvanced persistent threats (APTs) by reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e.,
fwindow of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete attacks. By r
implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components, organizations can
provide a trusted, known state computing resource for a specific time period that does not give t
sadversaries sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems or operating
denvironments. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat with regard to capability, intent,
i.and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will o
be successful. Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using
protected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence
0increases the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach organizational
systems. /
Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, periodically reimaging T
components, or using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can
8be implemented by using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new
instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of -
periodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require organizations to
first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that
may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components and services
occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not
with such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components and
services may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum
windows of vulnerabilities.

(b)Delete information when no longer needed.
Discussion:  Retaining information longer than is needed makes the information a potential
target for advanced adversaries searching for high value assets to compromise through
unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized modification, or exfiltration. For system-related
information, unnecessary retention provides advanced adversaries information that can b
licassist in their reconnaissance and lateral movement through the system.

Discussion:  Persistent connections to systems can provide advanced adversaries with paths e
to move laterally through systems and potentially position themselves closer to high value o
cassets. Limiting the availability of such connections impedes the adversaryâ€™s ability to move
freely through organizational systems. r
