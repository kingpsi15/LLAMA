1.4RELATIONSHIPTOOTHERPUBLICATIONS
This publication defines controls to satisfy a diverse set of security and privacy requirements
that have been levied on information systems and organizations and that are consistent with
and complementary to other recognized national and international information security and
privacy standards. To develop a broadly applicable and technically sound set of controls for
binformation systems and organizations, many sources were considered during the development
aof this publication. These sources included requirements and controls from the manufacturing,
defense, financial, healthcare, transportation, energy, intelligence, industrial control, and audit n
communities as well as national and international standards organizations. In addition, the
acontrols in this publication are used by the national security community in publications such as
] to provide Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction No. 1253 [CNSSI 1253b
guidance specific to systems designated as national security systems. Whenever possible, the f
econtrols have been mapped to international standards to help ensure maximum usability and
f22applicability. The relationship of this publication to other risk management, security, privacy,
aand publications can be found at [FISMA IMP].
o1.5REVISIONSANDEXTENSIONS       m
tThe security and privacy controls described in this publication represent the state-of-the-t
:practice protection measures for individuals, information systems, and organizations. The
ocontrols are reviewed and revised periodically to reflect the experience gained from using the
controls; new or revised laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards; r
changing security and privacy requirements; emerging threats, vulnerabilities, attack and
information processing methods; and the availability of new technologies. 0
IThe security and privacy controls in the control catalog are also expected to change over time as
controls are withdrawn, revised, and added. In addition to the need for change, the need for .
stability is addressed by requiring that proposed modifications to security and privacy controls .
go through a rigorous and transparent public review process to obtain public and private sector 0
feedback and to build a consensus for such change. The review process provides a technically 3
sound, flexible, and stable set of security and privacy controls for the organizations that use the
control catalog.
1.6PUBLICATIONORGANIZATION
The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:
21 Authorizing officials or their designated representatives, by accepting the security and privacy plans, agree to the
security and privacy controls proposed to meet the security and privacy requirements for organizations and systems.
22 Mapping tables are available at [SP 800-53 RES].
