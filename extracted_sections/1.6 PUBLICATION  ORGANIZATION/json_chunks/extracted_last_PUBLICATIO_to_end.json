To develop a broadly applicable and technically sound set of controls for\nbinformation systems and organizations, many sources were considered during the development\naof this publication. These sources included requirements and controls from the manufacturing,\ndefense, financial, healthcare, transportation, energy, intelligence, industrial control, and audit n\ncommunities as well as national and international standards organizations. In addition, the\nacontrols in this publication are used by the national security community in publications such as\n] to provide Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction No. 1253 [CNSSI 1253b\nguidance specific to systems designated as national security systems. Whenever possible, the f\necontrols have been mapped to international standards to help ensure maximum usability and\nf22applicability. The relationship of this publication to other risk management, security, privacy,\naand publications can be found at [FISMA IMP].\no1.5REVISIONSANDEXTENSIONS       m\ntThe security and privacy controls described in this publication represent the state-of-the-t\n:practice protection measures for individuals, information systems, and organizations. The\nocontrols are reviewed and revised periodically to reflect the experience gained from using the\ncontrols; new or revised laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards; r\nchanging security and privacy requirements; emerging threats, vulnerabilities, attack and\ninformation processing methods; and the availability of new technologies. 0\nIThe security and privacy controls in the control catalog are also expected to change over time as\ncontrols are withdrawn, revised, and added. In addition to the need for change, the need for .\nstability is addressed by requiring that proposed modifications to security and privacy controls .\ngo through a rigorous and transparent public review process to obtain public and private sector 0\nfeedback and to build a consensus for such change. The review process provides a technically 3\nsound, flexible, and stable set of security and privacy controls for the organizations that use the\ncontrol catalog.\n1.6PUBLICATIONORGANIZATION\nThe remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:\n21 Authorizing officials or their designated representatives, by accepting the security and privacy plans, agree to the\nsecurity and privacy controls proposed to meet the security and privacy requirements for organizations and systems.\n22 Mapping tables are available at [SP 800-53 RES].\nCHAPTER ONE  PAGE5\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u2022 describes the fundamental concepts associated with security and privacy  Chapter Two\ncontrols, including the structure of the controls, how the controls are organized in the\nconsolidated catalog, control implementation approaches, the relationship between security\nand privacy controls, and trustworthiness and assurance.\n\u2022 provides a consolidated catalog of security and privacy controls including a  Chapter Three\ndiscussion section to explain the purpose of each control and to provide useful information\nregarding control implementation and assessment, a list of related controls to show the\nrelationships and dependencies among controls, and a list of references to supporting\npublications that may be helpful to organizations.\n\u2022, , , and  provide additional information on  ReferencesGlossaryAcronymsControl Summaries\n23the use of security and privacy controls.\n23 Unless otherwise stated, all references to NIST publications refer to the most recent version of those publications.\nCHAPTER ONE  PAGE6"
