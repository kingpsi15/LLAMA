8SR-5 ACQUISITION STRATEGIES, TOOLS, AND METHODS
5 Control:  Employthe following acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods
5Assignment: organization-defined to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks: [
acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods].
Discussion:  The use of the acquisition process provides an important vehicle to protect the
supply chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end
use of a system or system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident
packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk
assessment can guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to
the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized production,
theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and
poor development practices throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations also

consider providing incentives for suppliers who implement controls, promote transparency into
their processes and security and privacy practices, provide contract language that addresses the
prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy
suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for
personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs
should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation,
and evidence are commensurate with the security and privacy requirements of the organization.
Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.

Discussion:  Adversaries can attempt to impede organizational operations by disrupting the b
licsupply of critical system components or corrupting supplier operations. Organizations may
itrack systems and component mean time to failure to mitigate the loss of temporary or o
permanent system function. Controls to ensure that adequate supplies of critical system is
components include the use of multiple suppliers throughout the supply chain for the
iidentified critical components, stockpiling spare components to ensure operation during la
mission-critical times, and the identification of functionally identical or similar components le
fthat may be used, if necessary. r

visual or physical inspection; static and dynamic analyses; visual, x-ray, or magnetic particle
inspections; simulations; white, gray, or black box testing; fuzz testing; stress testing; and 8
