SR-11 COMPONENT AUTHENTICITY
aControl:
la.Develop and implement anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include the means to  a
ldetect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the system; and e
Selection (one or more): source of counterfeit eb.Report counterfeit system components to [
component;Assignment: organization-defined external reporting organizations; [] f
Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles[]].
Discussion:  Sources of counterfeit components include manufacturers, developers, vendors, and
ocontractors. Anti-counterfeiting policies and procedures support tamper resistance and provide a  m
:level of protection against the introduction of malicious code. External reporting organizations
tinclude CISA. p
