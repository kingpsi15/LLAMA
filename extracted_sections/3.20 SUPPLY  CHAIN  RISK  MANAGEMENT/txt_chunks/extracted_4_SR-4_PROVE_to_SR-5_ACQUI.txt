Discussion:  Every system and system component has a point of origin and may be changed
throughout its existence. Provenance is the chronology of the origin, development, ownership,
location, and changes to a system or system component and associated data. It may also include
personnel and processes used to interact with or make modifications to the system, component,
SR-1) for allocating or associated data. Organizations consider developing procedures (see
responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance for systems and
system components; transferring provenance documentation and responsibility between
organizations; and preventing and monitoring for unauthorized changes to the provenance
records. Organizations have methods to document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance
baselines for systems, system components, and related data. These actions help track, assess,

configuration, and help ensure non-repudiation of provenance information and the provenance
change records. Provenance considerations are addressed throughout the system development
life cycle and incorporated into contracts and other arrangements, as appropriate.

Assignment: organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and components: [
personnel associated with organization-defined systems and critical system components].
hDiscussion:  Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is critical to
gaining visibility into supply chain activities. Visibility into supply chain activities is also p
bimportant for monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable
visibility into supply chains elements, processes, and personnel, it is very difficult for a
organizations to understand and manage risk and reduce their susceptibility to adverse
isevents. Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools used for the research
vand development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations,
lmaintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes a
linclude development processes for hardware, software, and firmware; shipping and handling e
rprocedures; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain e
provenance; personnel and physical security programs; or other programs, processes, or o
cprocedures associated with the production and distribution of supply chain elements. Supply
chain personnel are individuals with specific roles and responsibilities related to the secure r
the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration,
ooperations and maintenance, and disposal of a system or system component. Identification
:methods are sufficient to support an investigation in case of a supply chain change (e.g. if a
tsupply company is purchased), compromise, or event. p

Discussion:  Tracking the unique identification of systems and system components during I
development and transport activities provides a foundational identity structure for the
Pestablishment and maintenance of provenance. For example, system components may be
labeled using serial numbers or tagged using radio-frequency identification tags. Labels and 0
tags can help provide better visibility into the provenance of a system or system component. 5
rA system or system component may have more than one unique identifier. Identification 5
methods are sufficient to support a forensic investigation after a supply chain compromise
or event.

cryptographic hash verifications or digital signatures, and visible anti-tamper labels or
stickers. Controls can also include monitoring for out of specification performance, which
can be an indicator of tampering or counterfeits. Organizations may leverage supplier and
contractor processes for validating that a system or component is genuine and has not been
altered and for replacing a suspect system or component. Some indications of tampering
may be visible and addressable before accepting delivery, such as inconsistent packaging,
broken seals, and incorrect labels. When a system or system component is suspected of
being altered or counterfeit, the supplier, contractor, or original equipment manufacturer
may be able to replace the item or provide a forensic capability to determine the origin of
the counterfeit or altered item. Organizations can provide training to personnel on how to
identify suspicious system or component deliveries.

Assignment: organization-defined controlsAssignment: Employ [] and conduct [p
borganization-defined analysis] to ensure the integrity of the system and system
acomponents by validating the internal composition and provenance of critical or mission-
essential technologies, products, and services. n
Discussion:  Authoritative information regarding the internal composition of system
components and the provenance of technology, products, and services provides a strong a
basis for trust. The validation of the internal composition and provenance of technologies,
products, and services is referred to as the pedigree. For microelectronics, this includes
ematerial composition of components. For software this includes the composition of open-
osource and proprietary code, including the version of the component at a given point in
time. Pedigrees increase the assurance that the claims suppliers assert about the internal h
rcomposition and provenance of the products, services, and technologies they provide are g
valid. The validation of the internal composition and provenance can be achieved by various f
evidentiary artifacts or records that manufacturers and suppliers produce during the m
research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, h
poperations and maintenance, and disposal of technology, products, and services. Evidentiary
/artifacts include, but are not limited to, software identification (SWID) tags, software /
component inventory, the manufacturers’ declarations of platform attributes (e.g., serial i.
rnumbers, hardware component inventory), and measurements (e.g., firmware hashes) that g
are tightly bound to the hardware itself. 0
