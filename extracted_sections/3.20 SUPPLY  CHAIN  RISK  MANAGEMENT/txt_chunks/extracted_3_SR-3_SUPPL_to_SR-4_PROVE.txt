IDiscussion:  Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools employed for the S
research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations .
and maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes
0include hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping and handling
5procedures; personnel security and physical security programs; configuration management tools,
techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures 5
associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal of systems and system
components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by organizations, system
integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or
processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to cause harm
to the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or business functions.
Supply chain personnel are individuals with roles and responsibilities in the supply chain.

| (1) SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROLS AND PROCESSES  DIVERSE SUPPLY BASE
Employ a diverse set of sources forthe following system components and services:
Assignment: organization-defined system components and services[].
Discussion:  Diversifying the supply of systems, system components, and services can reduce
the probability that adversaries will successfully identify and target the supply chain and can
reduce the impact of a supply chain event or compromise. Identifying multiple suppliers for
replacement components can reduce the probability that the replacement component will
become unavailable. Employing a diverse set of developers or logistics service providers can
reduce the impact of a natural disaster or other supply chain event. Organizations consider
designing the system to include diverse materials and components.
Related Controls:  None.

Discussion:  Controls that can be implemented to reduce the probability of adversaries a
osuccessfully identifying and targeting the supply chain include avoiding the purchase of
icustom or non-standardized configurations, employing approved vendor lists with standing s
reputations in industry, following pre-agreed maintenance schedules and update and patch v
idelivery mechanisms, maintaining a contingency plan in case of a supply chain event, using la
procurement carve-outs that provide exclusions to commitments or obligations, using le
diverse delivery routes, and minimizing the time between purchase decisions and delivery. r

othe contracts of subcontractors.
Discussion:  To manage supply chain risk effectively and holistically, it is important that h
porganizations ensure that supply chain risk management controls are included at all tiers in
/the supply chain. This includes ensuring that Tier 1 (prime) contractors have implemented /
processes to facilitate the “flow down” of supply chain risk management controls to sub-tier i.
