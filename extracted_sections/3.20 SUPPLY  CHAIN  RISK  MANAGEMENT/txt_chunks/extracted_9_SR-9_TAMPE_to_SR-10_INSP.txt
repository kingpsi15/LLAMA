SR-9 TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION :
pControl:  Implement a tamper protection program for the system, system component, or system  s
service. /
oDiscussion:  Anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques provide a level of protection for
systems, system components, and services against many threats, including reverse engineering, /
modification, and substitution. Strong identification combined with tamper resistance and/or .
tamper detection is essential to protecting systems and components during distribution and 2
/when in use. N
Related Controls:  PE-3, PM-30, SA-15, SI-4, SI-7, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-10, SR-11.

5Employ anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques throughout the system
development life cycle.
Discussion:  The system development life cycle includes research and development, design,
manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal.
Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance
and detection. Organizations use obfuscation and self-checking to make reverse engineering
and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. The
customization of systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect
and therefore limit damage.
Related Controls:  SA-3.
