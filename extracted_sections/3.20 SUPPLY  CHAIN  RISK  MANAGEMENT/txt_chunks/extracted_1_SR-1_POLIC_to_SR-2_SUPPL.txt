Discussion:  Supply chain risk management policy and procedures address the controls in the SR :
family as well as supply chain-related controls in other families that are implemented within o
osystems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing
/such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
.assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the
development of supply chain risk management policy and procedures. Security and privacy 2
/program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may N
obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be
Sincluded as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies
.that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and 8
0privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
3describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to
supply chain risk management policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,
security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an
organizational policy or procedure.
Related Controls:  PM-9, PM-30, PS-8, SI-12.
Control Enhancements:  None.
