  "content": "SR-9 TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION :\npControl:  Implement a tamper protection program for the system, system component, or system  s\nservice. /\noDiscussion:  Anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques provide a level of protection for\nsystems, system components, and services against many threats, including reverse engineering, /\nmodification, and substitution. Strong identification combined with tamper resistance and/or .\ntamper detection is essential to protecting systems and components during distribution and 2\n/when in use. N\nRelated Controls:  PE-3, PM-30, SA-15, SI-4, SI-7, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-10, SR-11.\n.Control Enhancements:\n-| (1) TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION  MULTIPLE STAGES OF SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE 5\n5Employ anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques throughout the system\ndevelopment life cycle.\nDiscussion:  The system development life cycle includes research and development, design,\nmanufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal.\nOrganizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance\nand detection. Organizations use obfuscation and self-checking to make reverse engineering\nand modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. The\ncustomization of systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect\nand therefore limit damage.\nRelated Controls:  SA-3.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 371\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nReferences:  [ISO 20243]."
