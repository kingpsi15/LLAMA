The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing\n/such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy\n.assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the\ndevelopment of supply chain risk management policy and procedures. Security and privacy 2\n/program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may N\nobviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be\nSincluded as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies\n.that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and 8\n0privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures\n3describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or\nrole that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and\nprivacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to\nsupply chain risk management policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,\nsecurity incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives,\nregulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an\norganizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PM-30, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 363\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nReferences:  [FASC18], [41 CFR 201], [EO 13873], [CNSSD 505], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-\n39], [SP 800-100], [SP 800-161]."
