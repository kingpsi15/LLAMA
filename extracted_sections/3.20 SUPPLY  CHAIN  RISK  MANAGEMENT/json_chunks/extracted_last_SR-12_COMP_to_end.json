For example, disposal can occur during research and development, design, prototyping, or\noperations/maintenance and include methods such as disk cleaning, removal of cryptographic\nkeys, partial reuse of components. Opportunities for compromise during disposal affect physical\nand logical data, including system documentation in paper-based or digital files; shipping and\nhdelivery documentation; memory sticks with software code; or complete routers or servers that\ninclude permanent media, which contain sensitive or proprietary information. Additionally, p\nbproper disposal of system components helps to prevent such components from entering the gray\nmarket. a\nRelated Controls:  MP-6.\nv References:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 373"
