Organizations consider developing procedures (see\nresponsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance for systems and\nsystem components; transferring provenance documentation and responsibility between\norganizations; and preventing and monitoring for unauthorized changes to the provenance\nrecords.

Visibility into supply chain activities is also p\nbimportant for monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable\nvisibility into supply chains elements, processes, and personnel, it is very difficult for a\norganizations to understand and manage risk and reduce their susceptibility to adverse\nisevents. Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools used for the research\nvand development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations,\nlmaintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes a\nlinclude development processes for hardware, software, and firmware; shipping and handling e\nrprocedures; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain e\nprovenance; personnel and physical security programs; or other programs, processes, or o\ncprocedures associated with the production and distribution of supply chain elements. Supply\nchain personnel are individuals with specific roles and responsibilities related to the secure r\nthe research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration,\nooperations and maintenance, and disposal of a system or system component. Identification\n:methods are sufficient to support an investigation in case of a supply chain change (e.g. if a\ntsupply company is purchased), compromise, or event. p\n/Related Controls:  IA-2, IA-8, PE-16. /\no| (2) PROVENANCE  TRACK AND TRACE\n1Establish and maintain unique identification of the following systems and critical system\n6Assignment: organization-defined components for tracking through the supply chain: [\nsystems and critical system components]. 8\nDiscussion:  Tracking the unique identification of systems and system components during I\ndevelopment and transport activities provides a foundational identity structure for the\nPestablishment and maintenance of provenance. For example, system components may be\nlabeled using serial numbers or tagged using radio-frequency identification tags. Labels and 0\ntags can help provide better visibility into the provenance of a system or system component. 5\nrA system or system component may have more than one unique identifier.

Controls can also include monitoring for out of specification performance, which\ncan be an indicator of tampering or counterfeits. Organizations may leverage supplier and\ncontractor processes for validating that a system or component is genuine and has not been\naltered and for replacing a suspect system or component. Some indications of tampering\nmay be visible and addressable before accepting delivery, such as inconsistent packaging,\nbroken seals, and incorrect labels. When a system or system component is suspected of\nbeing altered or counterfeit, the supplier, contractor, or original equipment manufacturer\nmay be able to replace the item or provide a forensic capability to determine the origin of\nthe counterfeit or altered item. Organizations can provide training to personnel on how to\nidentify suspicious system or component deliveries.\n.

The validation of the internal composition and provenance of technologies,\nproducts, and services is referred to as the pedigree. For microelectronics, this includes\nematerial composition of components. For software this includes the composition of open-\nosource and proprietary code, including the version of the component at a given point in\ntime. Pedigrees increase the assurance that the claims suppliers assert about the internal h\nrcomposition and provenance of the products, services, and technologies they provide are g\nvalid. The validation of the internal composition and provenance can be achieved by various f\nevidentiary artifacts or records that manufacturers and suppliers produce during the m\nresearch and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, h\npoperations and maintenance, and disposal of technology, products, and services. Evidentiary\n/artifacts include, but are not limited to, software identification (SWID) tags, software /\ncomponent inventory, the manufacturers\u2019 declarations of platform attributes (e.g., serial i.\nrnumbers, hardware component inventory), and measurements (e.g., firmware hashes) that g\nare tightly bound to the hardware itself. 0\n0Related Controls:  RA-3.\nNReferences:  [FASC18], [41 CFR 201], [EO 13873], [ISO 27036], [ISO 20243], [SP 800-160-1], [SP\n800-161], [IR 7622], [IR 8112], [IR 8272].
