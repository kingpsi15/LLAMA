There are many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end\nuse of a system or system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident\npackaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk\nassessment can guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to\nthe situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized production,\ntheft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and\npoor development practices throughout the system development life cycle.

Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for\npersonnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs\nshould be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation,\nand evidence are commensurate with the security and privacy requirements of the organization.\nContracts may specify documentation protection requirements.\n.

These include malicious code, malicious processes, defective software,\nbackdoors, and counterfeits. Assessments can include evaluations; design proposal reviews;\nvisual or physical inspection; static and dynamic analyses; visual, x-ray, or magnetic particle\ninspections; simulations; white, gray, or black box testing; fuzz testing; stress testing; and 8\nSR-6(1)). Evidence generated during assessments is documented for penetration testing (see\nTfollow-on actions by organizations. The evidence generated during the organizational or\nindependent assessments of supply chain elements may be used to improve supply chain P\nprocesses and inform the supply chain risk management process.
