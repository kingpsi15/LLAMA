The reviews\nconsider documented processes, documented controls, all-source intelligence, and publicly\navailable information related to the supplier or contractor. Organizations can use open-source\ninformation to monitor for indications of stolen information, poor development and quality\ncontrol practices, information spillage, or counterfeits. In some cases, it may be appropriate or\nrequired to share assessment and review results with other organizations in accordance with any\napplicable rules, policies, or inter-organizational agreements or contracts.\nRelated Controls:  SR-3, SR-5.\nControl Enhancements:\ni| s(1) SUPPLIER ASSESSMENTS AND REVIEWS  TESTING AND ANALYSIS\nSelection (one or more): organizational analysis; independent third-party analysis; Employ [b\nlicorganizational testing; independent third-party testing] of the following supply chain\nielements, processes, and actors associated with the system, system component, or system o\nAssignment: organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and actorsservice: []. is\nvDiscussion:  Relationships between entities and procedures within the supply chain,\nlincluding development and delivery, are considered. Supply chain elements include a\nlorganizations, entities, or tools that are used for the research and development, design, e\nrmanufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and disposal of e\nsystems, system components, or system services. Supply chain processes include supply o\ncchain risk management programs; SCRM strategies and implementation plans; personnel\nand physical security programs; hardware, software, and firmware development processes; r\nconfiguration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance;\noshipping and handling procedures; and programs, processes, or procedures associated with\n:the production and distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain actors are individuals\ntwith specific roles and responsibilities in the supply chain. The evidence generated and p\n:collected during analyses and testing of supply chain elements, processes, and actors is /\nodocumented and used to inform organizational risk management activities and decisions.\nrRelated Controls:  CA-8, SI-4. g\nReferences:  [FASC18], [41 CFR 201], [EO 13873], [ISO 27036], [ISO 20243], [FIPS 140-3], [FIPS .\n180-4], [FIPS 186-4], [FIPS 202], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-161], [IR 7622], [IR 8272]. 2"
