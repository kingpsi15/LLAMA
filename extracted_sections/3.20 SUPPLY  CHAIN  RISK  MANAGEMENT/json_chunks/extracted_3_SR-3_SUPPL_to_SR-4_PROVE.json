Supply chain processes\n0include hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping and handling\n5procedures; personnel security and physical security programs; configuration management tools,\ntechniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures 5\nassociated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal of systems and system\ncomponents. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by organizations, system\nintegrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or\nprocesses represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to cause harm\nto the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or business functions.\nSupply chain personnel are individuals with roles and responsibilities in the supply chain.\nRelated Controls:  CA-2, MA-2, MA-6, PE-3, PE-16, PL-8, PM-30, SA-2, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-9,\nSA-10, SA-15, SC-7, SC-29, SC-30, SC-38, SI-7, SR-6, SR-9, SR-11.\nControl Enhancements:\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 365\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n| (1) SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROLS AND PROCESSES  DIVERSE SUPPLY BASE\nEmploy a diverse set of sources forthe following system components and services:\nAssignment: organization-defined system components and services[].\nDiscussion:  Diversifying the supply of systems, system components, and services can reduce\nthe probability that adversaries will successfully identify and target the supply chain and can\nreduce the impact of a supply chain event or compromise. Identifying multiple suppliers for\nreplacement components can reduce the probability that the replacement component will\nbecome unavailable. Employing a diverse set of developers or logistics service providers can\nreduce the impact of a natural disaster or other supply chain event. Organizations consider\ndesigning the system to include diverse materials and components.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION CONTROLS AND PROCESSES  LIMITATION OF HARMT\ni sEmploythe following controls to limit harm from potential adversaries identifying and\nuAssignment: organization-defined controlstargeting the organizational supply chain: [].\nDiscussion:  Controls that can be implemented to reduce the probability of adversaries a\nosuccessfully identifying and targeting the supply chain include avoiding the purchase of\nicustom or non-standardized configurations, employing approved vendor lists with standing s\nreputations in industry, following pre-agreed maintenance schedules and update and patch v\nidelivery mechanisms, maintaining a contingency plan in case of a supply chain event, using la\nprocurement carve-outs that provide exclusions to commitments or obligations, using le\ndiverse delivery routes, and minimizing the time between purchase decisions and delivery. r\nRelated Controls:  None. o\n|- (3) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION CONTROLS AND PROCESSES  SUBTIER FLOW DOWNa\neEnsure that the controls included in the contracts of prime contractors are also included in\nothe contracts of subcontractors.\nDiscussion:  To manage supply chain risk effectively and holistically, it is important that h\nporganizations ensure that supply chain risk management controls are included at all tiers in\n/the supply chain. This includes ensuring that Tier 1 (prime) contractors have implemented /\nprocesses to facilitate the \u201cflow down\u201d of supply chain risk management controls to sub-tier i.\nrSR-3b. contractors. The controls subject to flow down are identified in\n0Related Controls:  SR-5, SR-8.\n2References:  [FASC18], [41 CFR 201], [EO 13873], [ISO 20243], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-161], [IR\nN7622]."
