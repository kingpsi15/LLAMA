OPSEC is a process that includes identifying critical information, analyzing friendly\nactions related to operations and other activities to identify actions that can be observed by\npotential adversaries, determining indicators that potential adversaries might obtain that could\nbe interpreted or pieced together to derive information in sufficient time to cause harm to\norganizations, implementing safeguards or countermeasures to eliminate or reduce exploitable\nvulnerabilities and risk to an acceptable level, and considering how aggregated information may\nexpose users or specific uses of the supply chain. Supply chain information includes user\nidentities; uses for systems, system components, and system services; supplier identities;\nsecurity and privacy requirements; system and component configurations; supplier processes;\ndesign specifications; and testing and evaluation results.
