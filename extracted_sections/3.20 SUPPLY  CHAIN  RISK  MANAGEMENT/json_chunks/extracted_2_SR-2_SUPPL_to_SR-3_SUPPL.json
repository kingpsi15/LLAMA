Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized a\naproduction, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software\nand hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply b\nchain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an\norganization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted e\nundertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships f\nhand communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management\ng(SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response\nfactions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance r\nagainst plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy\nimplementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or\nincorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing, s\n/implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems d\niacross the SDLC to support mission and business functions. .\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are 1\ntailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans 6\n2provide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is\nNfit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans\nhelp organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions T\nbased on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk\n8management plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization,\nacceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently\n3evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating\nthe plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and\nassociated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address\nrequirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system\ncomponents and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented\n). as part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8\nRelated Controls:  CA-2, CP-4, IR-4, MA-2, MA-6, PE-16, PL-2, PM-9, PM-30, RA-3, RA-7, SA-8, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN  ESTABLISH SCRM TEAM\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 364\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAssignment: organization-Establish a supply chain risk management team consisting of [\ndefined personnel, roles, and responsibilitiesthe following SCRM ] to lead and support\nAssignment: organization-defined supply chain risk management activitiesactivities: [].\nDiscussion: To implement supply chain risk management plans, organizations establish a\ncoordinated, team-based approach to identify and assess supply chain risks and manage\nthese risks by using programmatic and technical mitigation techniques. The team approach\nenables organizations to conduct an analysis of their supply chain, communicate with\ninternal and external partners or stakeholders, and gain broad consensus regarding the\nappropriate resources for SCRM. The SCRM team consists of organizational personnel with\ndiverse roles and responsibilities for leading and supporting SCRM activities, including risk\nexecutive, information technology, contracting, information security, privacy, mission or\nbusiness, legal, supply chain and logistics, acquisition, business continuity, and other\nrelevant functions. Members of the SCRM team are involved in various aspects of the SDLC\nand, collectively, have an awareness of and provide expertise in acquisition processes, legal\nppractices, vulnerabilities, threats, and attack vectors, as well as an understanding of the\ntechnical aspects and dependencies of systems. The SCRM team can be an extension of the lic\nsecurity and privacy risk management processes or be included as part of an organizational\nrisk management team. n\nRelated Controls:  None. a\nlReferences: [FASC18], [41 CFR 201], [EO 13873], [CNSSD 505], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP-800-a\nl160-1], [SP 800-161], [SP 800-181], [IR 7622], [IR 8272]. e"
