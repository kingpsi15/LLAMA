  "content": "1.1PURPOSEANDAPPLICABILITY l     e\nThis publication establishes controls for systems and organizations. The controls can be e\nfimplemented within any organization or system that processes, stores, or transmits information.\n10The use of these controls is mandatory for federal information systems in accordance with a\neOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 [OMB A-130] and the provisions of the\n11oFederal Information Security Modernization Act [FISMA], which requires the implementation\n:12of minimum controls to protect federal information and information systems. This publication,\nalong with other supporting NIST publications, is designed to help organizations identify the p\n/security and privacy controls needed to manage risk and to satisfy the security and privacy /\nrequirements in FISMA, the Privacy Act of 1974 [PRIVACT], OMB policies (e.g., [OMB A-130]), i.\ngand designated Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), among others. It accomplishes\n0this objective by providing a comprehensive and flexible catalog of security and privacy controls\nto meet current and future protection needs based on changing threats, vulnerabilities,\n/requirements, and technologies. The publication also improves communication among N\norganizations by providing a common lexicon that supports the discussion of security, privacy,\nand risk management concepts.\n58 The Risk Management Framework in [SP 800-37] is an example of a comprehensive risk management process.\n9 This includes risk to critical infrastructure and key resources described in [HSPD-7].\n10 federal information systemA  is an information system used or operated by an agency, a contractor of an agency, or\nanother organization on behalf of an agency.\n11 Information systems that have been designated as national security systems, as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542,\nare not subject to the requirements in [FISMA]. However, the controls established in this publication may be selected\nfor national security systems as otherwise required (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974) or with the approval of federal\nofficials exercising policy authority over such systems. [CNSSP 22] and [CNSSI 1253] provide guidance for national\nsecurity systems. [DODI 8510.01] provides guidance for the Department of Defense.\n12 While the controls established in this publication are mandatory for federal information systems and organizations,\nother organizations such as state, local, and tribal governments as well as private sector organizations are encouraged\nto consider using these guidelines, as appropriate. See [SP 800-53B] for federal control baselines.\nCHAPTER ONE  PAGE2"
