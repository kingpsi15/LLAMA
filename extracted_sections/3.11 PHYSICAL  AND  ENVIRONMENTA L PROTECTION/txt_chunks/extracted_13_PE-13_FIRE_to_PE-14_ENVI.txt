oPE-13 FIRE PROTECTION
Control:  Employ and maintain fire detection and suppression systems that are supported by an
independent energy source.
Discussion:  The provision of fire detection and suppression systems applies primarily to 8
organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources, including data centers,
Tserver rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Fire detection and suppression systems that may
require an independent energy source include sprinkler systems and smoke detectors. An P
independent energy source is an energy source, such as a microgrid, that is separate, or can be
separated, from the energy sources providing power for the other parts of the facility. -

Discussion:  Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if
individuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or clearances (e.g., to
