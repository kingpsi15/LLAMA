/PE-5 ACCESS CONTROL FOR OUTPUT DEVICES /
oAssignment: organization-defined output Control:  Control physical access to output from [
devices/] to prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output.
Discussion:  Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output devices in 0
8locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access controls and allowing
access to authorized individuals only, placing output devices in locations that can be monitored I
by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using headphones. Examples of output
Pfacsimile machines, andcopiers. devices include monitors, printers, scanners, audio devices,
0Related Controls:  PE-2, PE-3, PE-4, PE-18.
rControl Enhancements:
| (1) ACCESS CONTROL FOR OUTPUT DEVICES  ACCESS TO OUTPUT BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PE-5.]
| (2) ACCESS CONTROL FOR OUTPUT DEVICES  LINK TO INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY
Link individual identity to receipt of output from output devices.
Discussion:  Methods for linking individual identity to the receipt of output from output
devices include installing security functionality on facsimile machines, copiers, and printers.
Such functionality allows organizations to implement authentication on output devices prior
to the release of output to individuals.
