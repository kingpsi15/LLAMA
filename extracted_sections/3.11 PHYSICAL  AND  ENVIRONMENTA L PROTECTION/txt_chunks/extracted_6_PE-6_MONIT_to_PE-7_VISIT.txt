PE-6 MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS
Control:
a.Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides to detect and respond to
physical security incidents;
Assignment: organization-defined frequencyb.Review physical access logs [] and upon
Assignment: organization-defined events or potential indications of eventsoccurrence of []; h
c.Coordinate results of reviews and investigations with the organizational incident response l ic
capability. t
Discussion:  Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within organizational is
facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video
isurveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can la
help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be le
fAU-2, if the access logs are part of an automated supported by audit logging controls, such as r
system. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security
incidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious c
aphysical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal
work hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of e
time, and out-of-sequence accesses. o

|  i(1) MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS  INTRUSION ALARMS AND SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT.
Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using physical intrusion /
alarms and surveillance equipment. .
2Discussion:  Physical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when
Nunauthorized access to the facility is attempted. Alarm systems work in conjunction with
physical barriers, physical access control systems, and security guards by triggering a
Sresponse when these other forms of security have been compromised or breached. Physical
.intrusion alarms can include different types of sensor devices, such as motion sensors, 8
0contact sensors, and broken glass sensors. Surveillance equipment includes video cameras
3installed at strategic locations throughout the facility.
Related Controls:  None.

defined automated mechanisms].
Discussion:  Response actions can include notifying selected organizational personnel or law
enforcement personnel. Automated mechanisms implemented to initiate response actions
include system alert notifications, email and text messages, and activating door locking
mechanisms. Physical access monitoring can be coordinated with intrusion detection

Assignment: organization-defined time period(c)Retain video recordings for [].
Discussion:  Video surveillance focuses on recording activity in specified areas for the
purposes of subsequent review, if circumstances so warrant. Video recordings are typically
reviewed to detect anomalous events or incidents. Monitoring the surveillance video is not
required, although organizations may choose to do so. There may be legal considerations
when performing and retaining video surveillance, especially if such surveillance is in a public
location.
