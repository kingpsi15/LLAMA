Control:
ISelection (one or more): temperature; humidity; pressure; radiation;Assignment: a.Maintain [ [ S
organization-defined environmental control]] levels within the facility where the system .
Assignment: organization-defined acceptable levelsresides at []; and
Assignment: organization-defined frequencyb.Monitor environmental control levels [].
Discussion:  The provision of environmental controls applies primarily to organizational facilities 5
that contain concentrations of system resources (e.g., data centers, mainframe computer rooms,
and server rooms). Insufficient environmental controls, especially in very harsh environments,
can have a significant adverse impact on the availability of systems and system components that
are needed to support organizational mission and business functions.

Discussion:  The implementation of automatic environmental controls provides an
immediate response to environmental conditions that can damage, degrade, or destroy
organizational systems or systems components.
Related Controls:  None.
