PE-2 PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS
Control:
a.Develop, approve, and maintain a list of individuals with authorized access to the facility
where the system resides;
b.Issue authorization credentials for facility access;
Assignment: c.Review the access list detailing authorized facility access by individuals [
organization-defined frequency]; and
d.Remove individuals from the facility access list when access is no longer required.
Discussion:  Physical access authorizations apply to employees and visitors. Individuals with
permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Authorization
hcredentials include ID badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the
strength of authorization credentials needed consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, p
bdirectives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Physical access authorizations may not
be necessary to access certain areas within facilities that are designated as publicly accessible. a

| (1) PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS  ACCESS BY POSITION OR ROLE f
Authorize physical access to the facility where the system resides based on position or
role. c
Discussion:  Role-based facility access includes access by authorized permanent and r
regular/routine maintenance personnel, duty officers, and emergency medical staff.
mRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-6.
t| (2) PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS  TWO FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION t
: /Require two forms of identification fromthe following forms of identification for visitor /
Assignment: organization-defined list of access to the facility where the system resides: [
racceptable forms of identification].
Discussion:  Acceptable forms of identification include passports, REAL ID-compliant driversâ€™ 0
licenses, and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards. For gaining access to facilities using 0
8automated mechanisms, organizations may use PIV cards, key cards, PINs, and biometrics.
SRelated Controls:  IA-2, IA-4, IA-5.
| (3)P PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS  RESTRICT UNESCORTED ACCESS
0Restrict unescorted access to the facility where the system resides to personnel with
5Selection (one or more): security clearances for all information contained within the [
system; formal access authorizations for all information contained within the system; need 5
for access to all information contained within the system; Assignment: organization-[
defined physical access authorizations]].
Discussion:  Individuals without required security clearances, access approvals, or need to
know are escorted by individuals with appropriate physical access authorizations to ensure
that information is not exposed or otherwise compromised.
