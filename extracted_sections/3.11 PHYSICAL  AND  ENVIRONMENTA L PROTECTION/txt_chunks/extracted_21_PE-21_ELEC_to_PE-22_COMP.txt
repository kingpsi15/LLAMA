8Discussion:  An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is a short burst of electromagnetic energy that is
spread over a range of frequencies. Such energy bursts may be natural or man-made. EMP I
interference may be disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment. Protective measures used
Pto mitigate EMP risk include shielding, surge suppressors, ferro-resonant transformers, and earth
0grounding. EMP protection may be especially significant for systems and applications that are
part of the U.S. critical infrastructure. 5
