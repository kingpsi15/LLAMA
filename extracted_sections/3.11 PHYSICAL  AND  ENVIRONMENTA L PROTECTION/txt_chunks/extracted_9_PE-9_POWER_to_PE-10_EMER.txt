PE-9 POWER EQUIPMENT AND CABLING o
Control:  Protect power equipment and power cabling for the system from damage and a
destruction. e
Discussion:  Organizations determine the types of protection necessary for the power equipment  m
and cabling employed at different locations that are both internal and external to organizational
pfacilities and environments of operation. Types of power equipment and cabling include internal
/cabling and uninterruptable power sources in offices or data centers, generators and power
cabling outside of buildings, and power sources for self-contained components such as satellites,
rvehicles, and other deployable systems.
Related Controls:  PE-4. .
Control Enhancements: 8
S|  (1) POWER EQUIPMENT AND CABLING  REDUNDANT CABLING
Assignment: Employ redundant power cabling paths that are physically separated by [
8organization-defined distance].
-Discussion:  Physically separate and redundant power cables ensure that power continues to
rflow in the event that one of the cables is cut or otherwise damaged.
Related Controls:  None.
|  (2) POWER EQUIPMENT AND CABLING  AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE CONTROLS
Assignment: organization-defined critical system Employ automatic voltage controls for [
components].
Discussion:  Automatic voltage controls can monitor and control voltage. Such controls
include voltage regulators, voltage conditioners, and voltage stabilizers.
Related Controls:  None.
References:  None.
