PE-11 EMERGENCY POWER le
Selection (one or more): an Control:  Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate [e
orderly shutdown of the system; transition of the system to long-term alternate power] in the
hevent of a primary power source loss.
eDiscussion:  An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism that
provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power source. A UPS is typically o
used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical :
tequipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious t
mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency :
power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from o
ounanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in
/batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but 1
.provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly 6
2shut down the system.

SControl Enhancements:
0|—   (1) EMERGENCY POWER  ALTERNATE POWER SUPPLY MINIMAL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY
Selection: manually; Provide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated [3
automatically] and that can maintain minimally required operational capability in the
event of an extended loss of the primary power source.
Discussion:  Provision of an alternate power supply with minimal operating capability can be
satisfied by accessing a secondary commercial power supply or other external power supply.
Related Controls:  None.
|—-  (2) EMERGENCY POWER  ALTERNATE POWER SUPPLY SELFCONTAINED
Selection: manually; Provide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated [
automatically] and that is:

Selection: minimally required operational capability; full (c)Capable of maintaining [
operational capability] in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.
Discussion:  The provision of a long-term, self-contained power supply can be satisfied by
using one or more generators with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the organization.
