rkeys are lost, combinations are compromised, or when individuals possessing the keys or
combinations are transferred or terminated.
hDiscussion:  Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent
gphysical access authorizations are not considered visitors. Physical access controls for publicly
faccessible areas may include physical access control logs/records, guards, or physical access
mdevices and barriers to prevent movement from publicly accessible areas to non-public areas.
hOrganizations determine the types of guards needed, including professional security staff, system
users, or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric s
/readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, executive d
iorders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in .
gthe types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination
0thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems
0that require supplemental access controls, or both. Components of systems may be in areas
designated as publicly accessible with organizations controlling access to the components.

Discussion:  Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for
those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.

Assignment: organization-defined frequencyPerform security checks [] at the physical
perimeter of the facility or system for exfiltration of information or removal of system
components.
Discussion:  Organizations determine the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of security
checks to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration.
Related Controls:  AC-4, SC-7.
| (3) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL  CONTINUOUS GUARDS
Assignment: organization-defined physical access pointsEmploy guards to control [] to the
facility where the system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
Discussion:  Employing guards at selected physical access points to the facility provides a
more rapid response capability for organizations. Guards also provide the opportunity for
Thuman surveillance in areas of the facility not covered by video surveillance.

tAssignment: organization-defined system Use lockable physical casings to protect [i
components ] from unauthorized physical access.
Discussion:  The greatest risk from the use of portable devices—such as smart phones, v
itablets, and notebook computers—is theft. Organizations can employ lockable, physical la
casings to reduce or eliminate the risk of equipment theft. Such casings come in a variety of le
sizes, from units that protect a single notebook computer to full cabinets that can protect r
multiple servers, computers, and peripherals. Lockable physical casings can be used in
conjunction with cable locks or lockdown plates to prevent the theft of the locked casing c
acontaining the computer equipment.

rDiscussion:  Organizations can implement tamper detection and prevention at selected
hardware components or implement tamper detection at some components and tamper
prevention at other components. Detection and prevention activities can employ many
types of anti-tamper technologies, including tamper-detection seals and anti-tamper 8
coatings. Anti-tamper programs help to detect hardware alterations through counterfeiting
Tand other supply chain-related risks.

Discussion:  An access control vestibule is part of a physical access control system that
typically provides a space between two sets of interlocking doors. Vestibules are designed to
prevent unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into facilities with
controlled access. This activity, also known as piggybacking or tailgating, results in
unauthorized access to the facility. Interlocking door controllers can be used to limit the
number of individuals who enter controlled access points and to provide containment areas
while authorization for physical access is verified. Interlocking door controllers can be fully
automated (i.e., controlling the opening and closing of the doors) or partially automated
(i.e., using security guards to control the number of individuals entering the containment
area).
Related Controls:  None.
