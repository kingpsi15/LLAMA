Permissions controlling output to the output devices are addressed in\nAC-4. Components are marked to indicate the impact level or classification level of the system to\nwhich the devices are connected, or the impact level or classification level of the information\npermitted to be output. Security marking refers to the use of human-readable security attributes.\nSecurity labeling refers to the use of security attributes for internal system data structures.\nSecurity marking is generally not required for hardware components that process, store, or\ntransmit information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly\nreleasable. However, organizations may require markings for hardware components that\nprocess, store, or transmit public information in order to indicate that such information is\npublicly releasable. Marking of system hardware components reflects applicable laws, executive\norders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. h\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-4,  AC-16, MP-3. u\nControl Enhancements:  None. a\nReferences:  [IR 8023]."
