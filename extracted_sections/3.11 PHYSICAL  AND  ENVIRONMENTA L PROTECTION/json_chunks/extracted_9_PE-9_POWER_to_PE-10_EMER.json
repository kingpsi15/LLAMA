  "content": "PE-9 POWER EQUIPMENT AND CABLING o\nControl:  Protect power equipment and power cabling for the system from damage and a\ndestruction. e\nDiscussion:  Organizations determine the types of protection necessary for the power equipment  m\nand cabling employed at different locations that are both internal and external to organizational\npfacilities and environments of operation. Types of power equipment and cabling include internal\n/cabling and uninterruptable power sources in offices or data centers, generators and power\ncabling outside of buildings, and power sources for self-contained components such as satellites,\nrvehicles, and other deployable systems.\nRelated Controls:  PE-4. .\nControl Enhancements: 8\nS|  (1) POWER EQUIPMENT AND CABLING  REDUNDANT CABLING\nAssignment: Employ redundant power cabling paths that are physically separated by [\n8organization-defined distance].\n-Discussion:  Physically separate and redundant power cables ensure that power continues to\nrflow in the event that one of the cables is cut or otherwise damaged.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|  (2) POWER EQUIPMENT AND CABLING  AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE CONTROLS\nAssignment: organization-defined critical system Employ automatic voltage controls for [\ncomponents].\nDiscussion:  Automatic voltage controls can monitor and control voltage. Such controls\ninclude voltage regulators, voltage conditioners, and voltage stabilizers.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 186\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
