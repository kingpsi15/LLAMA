Fire detection and suppression systems that may\nrequire an independent energy source include sprinkler systems and smoke detectors. An P\nindependent energy source is an energy source, such as a microgrid, that is separate, or can be\nseparated, from the energy sources providing power for the other parts of the facility. -\n5Related Controls:  AT-3.\nControl Enhancements:\n|\u2014 (1) FIRE PROTECTION  DETECTION SYSTEMS  AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION AND NOTIFICATION\nAssignment: Employ fire detection systems that activate automatically and notify [\norganization-defined personnel or rolesAssignment: organization-defined ] and [\nemergency responders] in the event of a fire.\nDiscussion:  Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if\nindividuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or clearances (e.g., to\nenter to facilities where access is restricted due to the classification or impact level of\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 188\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\ninformation within the facility).
