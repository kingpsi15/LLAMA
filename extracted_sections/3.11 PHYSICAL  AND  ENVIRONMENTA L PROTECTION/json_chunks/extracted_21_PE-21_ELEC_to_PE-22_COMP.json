Such energy bursts may be natural or man-made. EMP I\ninterference may be disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment. Protective measures used\nPto mitigate EMP risk include shielding, surge suppressors, ferro-resonant transformers, and earth\n0grounding. EMP protection may be especially significant for systems and applications that are\npart of the U.S. critical infrastructure. 5\nRelated Controls:  PE-18, PE-19.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  None."
