The risk management .\ngstrategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and\n0procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security\nand privacy programs collaborate on the development of physical and environmental protection 0\n8policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization\nIlevel are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies\nand procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or .\nbe represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures\n0can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for\nsystems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can 5\nbe directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be 5\ndocumented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events\nthat may precipitate an update to physical and environmental protection policy and procedures\ninclude assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply\nrestating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  AT-3, PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 179\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
