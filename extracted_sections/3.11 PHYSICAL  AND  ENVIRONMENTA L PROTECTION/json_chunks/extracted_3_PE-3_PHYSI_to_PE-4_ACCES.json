Individuals with permanent\ngphysical access authorizations are not considered visitors. Physical access controls for publicly\nfaccessible areas may include physical access control logs/records, guards, or physical access\nmdevices and barriers to prevent movement from publicly accessible areas to non-public areas.\nhOrganizations determine the types of guards needed, including professional security staff, system\nusers, or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric s\n/readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, executive d\niorders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in .\ngthe types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination\n0thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems\n0that require supplemental access controls, or both. Components of systems may be in areas\ndesignated as publicly accessible with organizations controlling access to the components.\nRelated Controls:  AT-3, AU-2, AU-6, AU-9, AU-13, CP-10, IA-3, IA-8, MA-5, MP-2, MP-4, PE-2, PE-T\n4, PE-5, PE-8, PS-2, PS-3, PS-6, PS-7, RA-3, SC-28, SI-4, SR-3.\n0Control Enhancements:\n3| (1) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL  SYSTEM ACCESS r\nEnforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the physical access\nAssignment: organization-defined physical spaces containing controls for the facility at [\none or more components of the system].\nDiscussion:  Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for\nthose areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL  FACILITY AND SYSTEMS\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 181\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAssignment: organization-defined frequencyPerform security checks [] at the physical\nperimeter of the facility or system for exfiltration of information or removal of system\ncomponents.\nDiscussion:  Organizations determine the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of security\nchecks to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration.\nRelated Controls:  AC-4, SC-7.\n| (3) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL  CONTINUOUS GUARDS\nAssignment: organization-defined physical access pointsEmploy guards to control [] to the\nfacility where the system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\nDiscussion:  Employing guards at selected physical access points to the facility provides a\nmore rapid response capability for organizations.

Organizations can employ lockable, physical la\ncasings to reduce or eliminate the risk of equipment theft. Such casings come in a variety of le\nsizes, from units that protect a single notebook computer to full cabinets that can protect r\nmultiple servers, computers, and peripherals. Lockable physical casings can be used in\nconjunction with cable locks or lockdown plates to prevent the theft of the locked casing c\nacontaining the computer equipment.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (5) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL  TAMPER PROTECTION\nAssignment: organization-defined anti-tamper technologiesSelection (one or tEmploy [] to [\n:more): detect; preventAssignment: organization-] physical tampering or alteration of [\ndefined hardware componentso] within the system.\nrDiscussion:  Organizations can implement tamper detection and prevention at selected\nhardware components or implement tamper detection at some components and tamper\nprevention at other components. Detection and prevention activities can employ many\ntypes of anti-tamper technologies, including tamper-detection seals and anti-tamper 8\ncoatings. Anti-tamper programs help to detect hardware alterations through counterfeiting\nTand other supply chain-related risks.\nRelated Controls:  SA-16, SR-9, SR-11.\n| (6) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL  FACILITY PENETRATION TESTING -\nr[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CA-8.]\n| (7) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL  PHYSICAL BARRIERS\nLimit access using physical barriers.\nDiscussion:  Physical barriers include bollards, concrete slabs, jersey walls, and hydraulic\nactive vehicle barriers.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (8) PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL  ACCESS CONTROL VESTIBULES\nAssignment: organization-defined locations within the Employ access control vestibules at [\nfacility].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 182\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  An access control vestibule is part of a physical access control system that\ntypically provides a space between two sets of interlocking doors. Vestibules are designed to\nprevent unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into facilities with\ncontrolled access. This activity, also known as piggybacking or tailgating, results in\nunauthorized access to the facility. Interlocking door controllers can be used to limit the\nnumber of individuals who enter controlled access points and to provide containment areas\nwhile authorization for physical access is verified. Interlocking door controllers can be fully\nautomated (i.e., controlling the opening and closing of the doors) or partially automated\n(i.e., using security guards to control the number of individuals entering the containment\narea).\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  [FIPS 201-2], [SP 800-73-4], [SP 800-76-2], [SP 800-78-4], [SP 800-116]."
