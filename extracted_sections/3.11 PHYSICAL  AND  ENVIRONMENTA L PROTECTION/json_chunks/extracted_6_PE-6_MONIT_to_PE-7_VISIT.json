Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video\nisurveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can la\nhelp identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be le\nfAU-2, if the access logs are part of an automated supported by audit logging controls, such as r\nsystem. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security\nincidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious c\naphysical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal\nwork hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of e\ntime, and out-of-sequence accesses. o\nRelated Controls:  AU-2, AU-6, AU-9, AU-12, CA-7, CP-10, IR-4, IR-8.h\nControl Enhancements: :\n|  i(1) MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS  INTRUSION ALARMS AND SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT.\nMonitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using physical intrusion /\nalarms and surveillance equipment. .\n2Discussion:  Physical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when\nNunauthorized access to the facility is attempted. Alarm systems work in conjunction with\nphysical barriers, physical access control systems, and security guards by triggering a\nSresponse when these other forms of security have been compromised or breached. Physical\n.intrusion alarms can include different types of sensor devices, such as motion sensors, 8\n0contact sensors, and broken glass sensors. Surveillance equipment includes video cameras\n3installed at strategic locations throughout the facility.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|  (2) MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS  AUTOMATED INTRUSION RECOGNITION AND RESPONSES\nAssignment: organization-defined classes or types of intrusionsRecognize [] and initiate\nAssignment: organization-defined response actionsAssignment: organization-[] using [\ndefined automated mechanisms].\nDiscussion:  Response actions can include notifying selected organizational personnel or law\nenforcement personnel. Automated mechanisms implemented to initiate response actions\ninclude system alert notifications, email and text messages, and activating door locking\nmechanisms. Physical access monitoring can be coordinated with intrusion detection\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 184\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nsystems and system monitoring capabilities to provide integrated threat coverage for the\norganization.\n.Related Controls:  SI-4\n|(3)  MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS  VIDEO SURVEILLANCE\nAssignment: organization-defined operational areas(a)Employ video surveillance of [];\nAssignment: organization-defined frequency(b)Review video recordings []; and\nAssignment: organization-defined time period(c)Retain video recordings for [].\nDiscussion:  Video surveillance focuses on recording activity in specified areas for the\npurposes of subsequent review, if circumstances so warrant. Video recordings are typically\nreviewed to detect anomalous events or incidents. Monitoring the surveillance video is not\nrequired, although organizations may choose to do so. There may be legal considerations\nwhen performing and retaining video surveillance, especially if such surveillance is in a public\nlocation.\nbRelated Controls:  None.\nt|  (4) iMONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS  MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS TO SYSTEMSo\niMonitor physical access to the system in addition to the physical access monitoring of the s\nAssignment: organization-defined physical spaces containing one or more facility at [v\nicomponents of the system]. la\nleDiscussion:  Monitoring physical access to systems provides additional monitoring for those\nareas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components, including server e\nPhysical access monitoring can be rooms, media storage areas, and communications centers.o\nccoordinated with intrusion detection systems and system monitoring capabilities to provide\ncomprehensive and integrated threat coverage for the organization. r\nRelated Controls:  None. f\nReferences:  None. :"
