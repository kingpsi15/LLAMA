A UPS is typically o\nused to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical :\ntequipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious t\nmission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency :\npower system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from o\nounanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in\n/batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but 1\n.provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly 6\n2shut down the system.\nRelated Controls:  AT-3, CP-2, CP-7.I\nSControl Enhancements:\n0|\u2014   (1) EMERGENCY POWER  ALTERNATE POWER SUPPLY MINIMAL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY\nSelection: manually; Provide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated [3\nautomatically] and that can maintain minimally required operational capability in the\nevent of an extended loss of the primary power source.\nDiscussion:  Provision of an alternate power supply with minimal operating capability can be\nsatisfied by accessing a secondary commercial power supply or other external power supply.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|\u2014-  (2) EMERGENCY POWER  ALTERNATE POWER SUPPLY SELFCONTAINED\nSelection: manually; Provide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated [\nautomatically] and that is:\n(a)Self-contained;\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 187\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(b)Not reliant on external power generation; and\nSelection: minimally required operational capability; full (c)Capable of maintaining [\noperational capability] in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.\nDiscussion:  The provision of a long-term, self-contained power supply can be satisfied by\nusing one or more generators with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the organization.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None."
