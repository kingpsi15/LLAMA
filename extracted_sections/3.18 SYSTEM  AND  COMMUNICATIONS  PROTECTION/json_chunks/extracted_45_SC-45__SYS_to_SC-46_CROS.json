Denial of service or failure to deny expired I\ncredentials may result without properly synchronized clocks within and between systems and\nPsystem components. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a\nmodern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The 0\n-granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks 5\nrand reference clocks, such as clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of\nmilliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for system components. Time\nservice can be critical to other security capabilities\u2014such as access control and identification and\nauthentication\u2014depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support the capabilities.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AU-8, IA-2, IA-8.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SYSTEM TIME SYNCHRONIZATION  SYNCHRONIZATION WITH AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE\nAssignment: organization-defined frequency(a)Compare the internal system clocks []\nAssignment: organization-defined authoritative time sourcewith []; and\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 328\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(b)Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time\nAssignment: organization-defined time perioddifference is greater than [].\nDiscussion:  Synchronization of internal system clocks with an authoritative source provides\nuniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected\nover a network.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) SYSTEM TIME SYNCHRONIZATION  SECONDARY AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE\n(a)Identify a secondary authoritative time source that is in a different geographic region\nthan the primary authoritative time source; and\n(b)Synchronize the internal system clocks to the secondary authoritative time source if\nthe primary authoritative time source is unavailable.\nDiscussion:  It may be necessary to employ geolocation information to determine that the\nsecondary authoritative time source is in a different geographic region.\nbRelated Controls:  None.\ntReferences:  [IETF 5905]. i"
