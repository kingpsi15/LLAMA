Information in\nshared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other r\ncontexts, control of information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and\nresidual information protection. Information in shared system resources does not address  m\ninformation remanence, which refers to the residual representation of data that has been\ntnominally deleted; covert channels (including storage and timing channels), where shared system p\n:resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within /\nosystems for which there are only single users or roles.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-4, SA-8.\n6Control Enhancements:\n| /(1) INFORMATION IN SHARED SYSTEM RESOURCES  SECURITY LEVELS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-4.]\n| (2) INFORMATION IN SHARED SYSTEM RESOURCES  MULTILEVEL OR PERIODS PROCESSING\n0Prevent unauthorized information transfer via shared resources in accordance with\nAssignment: organization-defined procedures[] when system processing explicitly switches 3\nbetween different information classification levels or security categories.\nDiscussion:  Changes in processing levels can occur during multilevel or periods processing\nwith information at different classification levels or security categories. It can also occur\nduring serial reuse of hardware components at different classification levels. Organization-\ndefined procedures can include approved sanitization processes for electronically stored\ninformation.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 295\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
