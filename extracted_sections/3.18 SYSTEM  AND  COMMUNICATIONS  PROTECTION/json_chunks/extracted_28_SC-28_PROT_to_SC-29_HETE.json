Such components include internal or external hard\ndisk drives, storage area network devices, or databases. However, the focus of protecting\ninformation at rest is not on the type of storage device or frequency of access but rather on the\nstate of the information. Information at rest addresses the confidentiality and integrity of\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 316\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\ninformation and covers user information and system information. System-related information\nthat requires protection includes configurations or rule sets for firewalls, intrusion detection and\nprevention systems, filtering routers, and authentication information. Organizations may employ\ndifferent mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of\ncryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for\nexample, by implementing write-once-read-many (WORM) technologies. When adequate\nprotection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved, organizations may employ other\ncontrols, including frequent scanning to identify malicious code at rest and secure offline storage\nin lieu of online storage.\nSC-Related Controls:  AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-19, CA-7, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CP-9, MP-4, MP-5, PE-3,\n8, SC-12, SC-13, SC-34, SI-3, SI-7, SI-16.\nControl Enhancements:\ni| s(1) PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST  CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION\nImplement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and b\nlicAssignment: organization-defined modification of the following information at rest on [\nisystem components or mediaAssignment: organization-defined information]: []. o\nisDiscussion:  The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the\nvconfidentiality and integrity of organizational information.
