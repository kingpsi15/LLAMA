Organizations define\nkey management requirements in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives,\nregulations, policies, standards, and guidelines and specify appropriate options, parameters, and\nlevels. Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust anchors are part of\nsuch trust stores. This includes certificates with visibility external to organizational systems and\nNIST CMVP] and [NIST CAVP] provide certificates related to the internal operations of systems.
