Covert channel analysis is a meaningful activity when there is the\npotential for unauthorized information flows across security domains, such as in the case of\nsystems that contain export-controlled information and have connections to external networks\n(i.e., networks that are not controlled by organizations). Covert channel analysis is also useful for\nmultilevel secure systems, multiple security level systems, and cross-domain systems.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-4, SA-8, SI-11.\nControl Enhancements: h\n| u(1) COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS  TEST COVERT CHANNELS FOR EXPLOITABILITY\nlicTest a subset of the identified covert channels to determine the channels that are\niexploitable. o\nisDiscussion:  None.\nRelated Controls:  None. a\n| (2) COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS  MAXIMUM BANDWIDTHle\nSelection (one or more): storage; Reduce the maximum bandwidth for identified covert [e\ntimingAssignment: organization-defined values] channels to []. o\nDiscussion:  The complete elimination of covert channels, especially covert timing channels, h\nis usually not possible without significant performance impacts. g\nfRelated Controls:  None. r\n|  (3) COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS  MEASURE BANDWIDTH IN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTSh\nAssignment: organization-defined subset of identified covert Measure the bandwidth of [s\n/channels] in the operational environment of the system. d\ni.Discussion:  Measuring covert channel bandwidth in specified operational environments o\nhelps organizations determine how much information can be covertly leaked before such /\nleakage adversely affects mission or business functions.
