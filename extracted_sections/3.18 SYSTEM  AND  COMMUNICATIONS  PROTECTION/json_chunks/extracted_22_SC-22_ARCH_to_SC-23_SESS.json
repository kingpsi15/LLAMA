  "content": "lSC-22 ARCHITECTURE AND PROVISIONING FOR NAME/ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE  ic\noControl:  Ensure the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an\niorganization are fault-tolerant and implement internal and external role separation. s\naDiscussion:  Systems that provide name and address resolution services include domain name\nsystem (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure in systems and enhance redundancy, b\norganizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system servers\u2014one configured as\nthe primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations e\ntypically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not f\nhlocated in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only\ngprocess name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal\nclients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution information f\nmrequests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks, including the\nhInternet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in certain roles\n(e.g., by address ranges and explicit lists). s\nRelated Controls:  SC-2, SC-20, SC-21, SC-24.o\ngControl Enhancements:  None.\n.References:  [SP 800-81-2]. 6"
