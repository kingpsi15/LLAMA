Protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of v\nldetermining whether the associated attachments or applications contain malicious code. While a\nlrelated to the concept of deception nets, the employment of detonation chambers is not e\nrintended to maintain a long-term environment in which adversaries can operate and their e\nactions can be observed. Rather, detonation chambers are intended to quickly identify malicious\nccode and either reduce the likelihood that the code is propagated to user environments of\noperation or prevent such propagation completely.\nRelated Controls:  SC-7, SC-18, SC-25, SC-26, SC-30, SC-35, SC-39, SI-3, SI-7.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\npReferences:  [SP 800-177]."
