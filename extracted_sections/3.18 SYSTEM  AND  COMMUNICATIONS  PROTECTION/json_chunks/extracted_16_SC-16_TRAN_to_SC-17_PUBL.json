Attributes are\nabstractions that represent the basic properties or characteristics of an entity with respect to\nprotecting information or the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes are\ntypically associated with internal data structures, including records, buffers, and files within the\nsystem. Security and privacy attributes are used to implement access control and information\nflow control policies; reflect special dissemination, management, or distribution instructions,\nincluding permitted uses of personally identifiable information; or support other aspects of the\ninformation security and privacy policies. Privacy attributes may be used independently or in\nconjunction with security attributes.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-4, AC-16.\nControl Enhancements:\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 310\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n| (1) TRANSMISSION OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  INTEGRITY VERIFICATION\nVerify the integrity of transmitted security and privacy attributes.\nDiscussion:  Part of verifying the integrity of transmitted information is ensuring that security\nand privacy attributes that are associated with such information have not been modified in\nan unauthorized manner. Unauthorized modification of security or privacy attributes can\nresult in a loss of integrity for transmitted information.\nRelated Controls:  AU-10, SC-8.\n|- (2) TRANSMISSION OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  ANTISPOOFING MECHANISMS\nImplement anti-spoofing mechanisms to prevent adversaries from falsifying the security\nattributes indicating the successful application of the security process.\nDiscussion:  Some attack vectors operate by altering the security attributes of an information\nsystem to intentionally and maliciously implement an insufficient level of security within the h\nsystem. The alteration of attributes leads organizations to believe that a greater number of\nsecurity functions are in place and operational than have actually been implemented. b\naRelated Controls:  SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.\n| (3) TRANSMISSION OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  CRYPTOGRAPHIC BINDINGis\nAssignment: organization-defined mechanisms or techniquesImplement [] to bind security v\nland privacy attributes to transmitted information. a\nleDiscussion:  Cryptographic mechanisms and techniques can provide strong security and\neprivacy attribute binding to transmitted information to help ensure the integrity of such\noinformation.\nhRelated Controls:  AC-16, SC-12, SC-13.\neReferences:  [OMB A-130]."
