Organizations\ndetermine the degree of physical separation of system components. Physical separation options\ninclude physically distinct components in separate racks in the same room, critical components in\nseparate rooms, and geographical separation of critical components. Security categorization can\nguide the selection of candidates for domain partitioning. Managed interfaces restrict or prohibit\nnetwork access and information flow among partitioned system components.\nRelated Controls:  AC-4, AC-6, SA-8, SC-2, SC-3, SC-7, SC-36.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 320\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SYSTEM PARTITIONING  SEPARATE PHYSICAL DOMAINS FOR PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS\nPartition privileged functions into separate physical domains.\nDiscussion:  Privileged functions that operate in a single physical domain may represent a\nsingle point of failure if that domain becomes compromised or experiences a denial of\nservice.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  [FIPS 199], [IR 8179]."
