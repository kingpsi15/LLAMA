To compound the problem, the inability of organizational officials to obtain r\ntimely information about disruptions or to provide timely direction to operational elements after\na communications path incident, can impact the ability of the organization to respond to such\nincidents in a timely manner. Establishing alternate communications paths for command and\ncontrol purposes, including designating alternative decision makers if primary decision makers\nare unavailable and establishing the extent and limitations of their actions, can greatly facilitate\nthe organization\u2019s ability to continue to operate and take appropriate actions during an incident.\nRelated Controls:  CP-2, CP-8.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [SP 800-34], [SP 800-61], [SP 800-160-2].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 329\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
