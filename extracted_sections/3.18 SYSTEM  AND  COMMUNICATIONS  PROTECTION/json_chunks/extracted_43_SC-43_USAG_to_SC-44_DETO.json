The usage\nrestrictions and implementation guidelines are based on the potential for system components to\ncause damage to the system and help to ensure that only authorized system use occurs.\nRelated Controls:  AC-18, AC-19, CM-6, SC-7, SC-18.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-124]."
