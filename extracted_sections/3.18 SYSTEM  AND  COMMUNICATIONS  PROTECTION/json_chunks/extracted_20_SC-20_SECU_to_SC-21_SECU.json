Additional artifacts include DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) digital signatures and h\nrcryptographic keys. Authoritative data includes DNS resource records. The means for indicating g\nthe security status of child zones include the use of delegation signer resource records in the f\nmDNS. Systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map between host and service names\nand network addresses provide other means to assure the authenticity and integrity of response h\ndata.\nRelated Controls:  AU-10, SC-8, SC-12, SC-13, SC-21, SC-22. o\nrControl Enhancements: g\n./()| (1) SECURE NAMEADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE  CHILD SUBSPACES 6\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-20.] 8\nS/()|(2) SECURE NAMEADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE  DATA ORIGIN AND\nS INTEGRITY\n8Provide data origin and integrity protection artifacts for internal name/address resolution\nqueries. -\nrDiscussion:  None. 5\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  [FIPS 140-3], [FIPS 186-4], [SP 800-81-2]."
