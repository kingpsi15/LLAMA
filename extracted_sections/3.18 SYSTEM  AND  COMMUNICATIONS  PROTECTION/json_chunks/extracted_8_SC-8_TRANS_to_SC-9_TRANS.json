Unprotected communication paths are exposed to the\npossibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of\ninformation can be accomplished by physical or logical means. Physical protection can be\nachieved by using protected distribution systems. A protected distribution system is a wireline or\nfiber-optics telecommunications system that includes terminals and adequate electromagnetic,\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 304\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nacoustical, electrical, and physical controls to permit its use for the unencrypted transmission of\nclassified information. Logical protection can be achieved by employing encryption techniques.\nOrganizations that rely on commercial providers who offer transmission services as commodity\nservices rather than as fully dedicated services may find it difficult to obtain the necessary\nassurances regarding the implementation of needed controls for transmission confidentiality and\nintegrity. In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality or integrity\nservices are available in standard, commercial telecommunications service packages. If it is not\nfeasible to obtain the necessary controls and assurances of control effectiveness through\nappropriate contracting vehicles, organizations can implement appropriate compensating\ncontrols.\nSC-Related Controls:  AC-17, AC-18, AU-10, IA-3, IA-8, IA-9, MA-4, PE-4, SA-4, SA-8, SC-7, SC-16,\n20, SC-23, SC-28.\niControl Enhancements: s\nb| (1) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY  CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION\nSelection (one or more): prevent unauthorized Implement cryptographic mechanisms to [t\nndisclosure of information; detect changes to information] during transmission.\nDiscussion:  Encryption protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification a\naduring transmission. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality and integrity\nbof information during transmission include TLS and IPSec. Cryptographic mechanisms used to\nprotect information integrity include cryptographic hash functions that have applications in\ndigital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. e\nRelated Controls:  SC-12,  SC-13.\nr|-- (2) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY  PRE AND POSTTRANSMISSION HANDLINGg\nfSelection (one or more): confidentiality; integrityMaintain the [] of information during r\npreparation for transmission and during reception.\ntDiscussion:  Information can be unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during t\npreparation for transmission or during reception, including during aggregation, at protocol :\ntransformation points, and during packing and unpacking. Such unauthorized disclosures or o\nomodifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information.\n1Related Controls:  None.\n|(3) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY  CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION FOR MESSAGE 2\n/ EXTERNALSN\nImplement cryptographic mechanisms to protect message externals unless otherwise T\nAssignment: organization-defined alternative physical controlsprotected by [].\nDiscussion:  Cryptographic protection for message externals addresses protection from the 0\n-unauthorized disclosure of information. Message externals include message headers and 5\nrrouting information. Cryptographic protection prevents the exploitation of message\nexternals and applies to internal and external networks or links that may be visible to\nindividuals who are not authorized users. Header and routing information is sometimes\ntransmitted in clear text (i.e., unencrypted) because the information is not identified by\norganizations as having significant value or because encrypting the information can result in\nlower network performance or higher costs. Alternative physical controls include protected\ndistribution systems.\nRelated Controls:  SC-12, SC-13.\n| (4) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY  CONCEAL OR RANDOMIZE COMMUNICATIONS\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 305\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nImplement cryptographic mechanisms to conceal or randomize communication patterns\nAssignment: organization-defined alternative physical unless otherwise protected by [\ncontrols].\nDiscussion:  Concealing or randomizing communication patterns addresses protection from\nunauthorized disclosure of information. Communication patterns include frequency, periods,\npredictability, and amount. Changes to communications patterns can reveal information\nwith intelligence value, especially when combined with other available information related\nto the mission and business functions of the organization. Concealing or randomizing\ncommunications prevents the derivation of intelligence based on communications patterns\nand applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals\nwho are not authorized users. Encrypting the links and transmitting in continuous, fixed, or\nrandom patterns prevents the derivation of intelligence from the system communications\npatterns. Alternative physical controls include protected distribution systems.\niRelated Controls:  SC-12, SC-13. s\nb| (5) TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY  PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM\nAssignment: organization-defined protected distribution systemSelection Implement [] to [t\nn(one or more): prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to\ninformation] during transmission.\nDiscussion:  The purpose of a protected distribution system is to deter, detect, and/or make\nbdifficult physical access to the communication lines that carry national security information.\nfRelated Controls:  None. r\noReferences:  [FIPS 140-3], [FIPS 197], [SP 800-52], [SP 800-77], [SP 800-81-2], [SP 800-113], [SP\n800-177], [IR 8023]. h"
