Trusted path mechanisms can only be activated by users or the security\nfunctions of organizational systems. User responses that occur via trusted paths are protected\nfrom modification by and disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ trusted\npaths for trustworthy, high-assurance connections between security functions of systems and\nusers, including during system logons. The original implementations of trusted paths employed\nan out-of-band signal to initiate the path, such as using the <BREAK> key, which does not\ntransmit characters that can be spoofed. In later implementations, a key combination that could\nnot be hijacked was used (e.g., the <CTRL> + <ALT> + <DEL> keys). Such key combinations, T\nihowever, are platform-specific and may not provide a trusted path implementation in every case. s\nThe enforcement of trusted communications paths is provided by a specific implementation that u\nlmeets the reference monitor concept. ic\noRelated Controls:  AC-16, AC-25, SC-12, SC-23.\nControl Enhancements: a\nl| (1) TRUSTED PATH  IRREFUTABLE COMMUNICATIONS PATHa\n(a)Provide a trusted communications path that is irrefutably distinguishable from other\necommunications paths; and\n(b)Initiate the trusted communications path for communications between the  f\nhAssignment: organization-defined security functions[] of the system and the user.\nDiscussion:  An irrefutable communications path permits the system to initiate a trusted path, e\nrwhich necessitates that the user can unmistakably recognize the source of the communication as o\na trusted system component. For example, the trusted path may appear in an area of the display :\ntthat other applications cannot access or be based on the presence of an identifier that cannot be\nspoofed.\noRelated Controls:  None.\ngReferences:  [OMB A-130]."
