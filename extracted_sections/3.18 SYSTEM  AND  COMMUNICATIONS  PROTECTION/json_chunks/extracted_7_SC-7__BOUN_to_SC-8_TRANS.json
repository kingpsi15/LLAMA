I\nSDiscussion:  Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based\n.malicious code analysis, virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a\n0security architecture. Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal\nnetworks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces 3\nwithin organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers\nwithin managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal\nSP addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses. [\n800-189] provides additional information on source address validation techniques to prevent\ningress and egress of traffic with spoofed addresses. Commercial telecommunications services\nare provided by network components and consolidated management systems shared by\ncustomers. These services may also include third party-provided access lines and other service\nelements. Such services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security\nprovisions. Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an\norganizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific\nboundary (i.e., an authorization boundary).\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 297\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  AC-4, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, AU-13, CA-3, CM-2, CM-4, CM-7, CM-10, CP-\n8, CP-10, IR-4, MA-4, PE-3, PL-8, PM-12, SA-8, SA-17, SC-5, SC-26, SC-32, SC-35, SC-43.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  PHYSICALLY SEPARATED SUBNETWORKS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7.]\n| (2) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  PUBLIC ACCESS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-7.]\n| (3) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  ACCESS POINTS\nLimit the number of external network connections to the system.\nDiscussion:  Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates monitoring of\ninbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet Connection [DHS TIC]\npinitiative is an example of a federal guideline that requires limits on the number of external\nnetwork connections. Limiting the number of external network connections to the system is  lic\nimportant during transition periods from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning\nfrom IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). Such transitions may require implementing the older n\nand newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the\nnumber of access points to the system. a\nRelated Controls:  None. b\nr| (4) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  EXTERNAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICESe\no(a)Implement a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;\n(b)Establish a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;\n(c)Protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across e\nreach interface; o\n:(d)Document each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission or\ntbusiness need and duration of that need; p\n/Assignment: organization-defined (e)Review exceptions to the traffic flow policy [ /\nfrequency] and remove exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission i.\nor business need; g\n0(f)Prevent unauthorized exchange of control plane traffic with external networks;\n(g)Publish information to enable remote networks to detect unauthorized control plane  2\n/traffic from internal networks; and N\n(h)Filter unauthorized control plane traffic from external networks.

This method of network access enables a\nhuser to access remote devices and simultaneously, access uncontrolled networks. Split\nptunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources,\nsuch as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external\naconnections, making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational\ninformation. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings that allow n\nissuch capability in remote devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being\nvconfigurable by users. Prevention can also be achieved by the detection of split tunneling (or\nlaof configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting\nlethe connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN)\ncan be used to securely provision a split tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking e\nconnectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments, or to a specific set of pre-o\ncapproved addresses, without user control.\nRelated Controls:  None. g\n|o (8) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  ROUTE TRAFFIC TO AUTHENTICATED PROXY SERVERS\nAssignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic  Assignment: Route []to[h\nporganization-defined external networks] through authenticated proxy servers at managed\n/interfaces. /\niDiscussion:  External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy server .\ngis a server (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients requesting\n0system resources from non-organizational or other organizational servers. System resources\n0that may be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests\nestablished through a connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and\nIprovide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices S\nare one of the most common proxy servers that provide access to the Internet. Proxy servers .\ncan support the logging of Transmission Control Protocol sessions and the blocking of\n0specific Uniform Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names. Web\n5proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized\nwebsites. Note that proxy servers may inhibit the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and 5\ncreate the potential for \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attacks (depending on the implementation).\nRelated Controls:  AC-3.\n| (9) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  RESTRICT THREATENING OUTGOING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC\n(a)Detect and deny outgoing communications traffic posing a threat to external systems;\n(b)Audit the identity of internal users associated with denied communications.\nDiscussion:  Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions that may pose\nthreats to external systems is known as extrusion detection. Extrusion detection is carried\nout within the system at managed interfaces. Extrusion detection includes the analysis of\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 299\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nincoming and outgoing communications traffic while searching for indications of internal\nthreats to the security of external systems.

Techniques used to prevent the exfiltration of information from\nTsystems may be implemented at internal endpoints, external boundaries, and across\nimanaged interfaces and include adherence to protocol formats, monitoring for beaconing s\nuactivity from systems, disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly\nlineeded, employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume and types of c\nttraffic expected, call backs to command and control centers, conducting penetration testing, i\nmonitoring for steganography, disassembling and reassembling packet headers, and using\ndata loss and data leakage prevention tools. Devices that enforce strict adherence to a\nprotocol formats include deep packet inspection firewalls and Extensible Markup Language\nb(XML) gateways. The devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specifications at the\napplication layer and identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices that operate f\nat the network or transport layers. The prevention of exfiltration is similar to data loss e\nprevention or data leakage prevention and is closely associated with cross-domain solutions f\nand system guards that enforce information flow requirements.\nRelated Controls:  AC-2, CA-8, SI-3. e\n|m (11) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  RESTRICT INCOMING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC\nAssignment: organization-defined authorized Only allow incoming communications from [t\nssourcesAssignment: organization-defined authorized destinations] to be routed to [].\nDiscussion:  General source address validation techniques are applied to restrict the use of o\noillegal and unallocated source addresses as well as source addresses that should only be\n/used within the system. The restriction of incoming communications traffic provides 1\n.determinations that source and destination address pairs represent authorized or allowed\n2communications. Determinations can be based on several factors, including the presence of\nsuch address pairs in the lists of authorized or allowed communications, the absence of such N\naddress pairs in lists of unauthorized or disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules for\nSStrong authentication of network authorized or allowed source and destination pairs.\n.addresses is not possible without the use of explicit security protocols, and thus, addresses 8\n0can often be spoofed. Further, identity-based incoming traffic restriction methods can be\n3employed, including router access control lists and firewall rules.\nRelated Controls:  AC-3.\n|- (12) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  HOSTBASED PROTECTION\nAssignment: organization-defined host-based boundary protection Implement [\nmechanismsAssignment: organization-defined system components] at [].\nDiscussion:  Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include host-based firewalls.\nSystem components that employ host-based boundary protection mechanisms include\nservers, workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 300\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n|,,(13) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  ISOLATION OF SECURITY TOOLS MECHANISMS AND SUPPORT\nCOMPONENTS\nAssignment: organization-defined information security tools, mechanisms, and Isolate [\nsupport components] from other internal system components by implementing physically\nseparate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of the system.\nDiscussion:  Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful in isolating\ncomputer network defenses from critical operational processing networks to prevent\nadversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques employed by\norganizations.\nRelated Controls:  SC-2, SC-3.\n| (14) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS\nAssignment: organization-defined Protect against unauthorized physical connections at [\nmanaged interfaces].\nbDiscussion:  Systems that operate at different security categories or classification levels may\nshare common physical and environmental controls, since the systems may share space a\nowithin the same facilities. In practice, it is possible that these separate systems may share\nicommon equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable distribution paths. Protection against s\nunauthorized physical connections can be achieved by using clearly identified and physically v\nlseparated cable trays, connection frames, and patch panels for each side of managed a\nlinterfaces with physical access controls that enforce limited authorized access to these e\nritems. e\noRelated Controls:  PE-4, PE-19.\n|a (15) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  NETWORKED PRIVILEGED ACCESSES\nRoute networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed interface for\npurposes of access control and auditing.  m\nDiscussion:  Privileged access provides greater accessibility to system functions, including h\npsecurity functions.

Managed interfaces include routers, firewalls, and application gateways that reside on\nprotected subnetworks (commonly referred to as demilitarized zones).

Such isolation limits unauthorized information flows among system\ncomponents and provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for selected\nsystem components. Isolating system components with boundary protection mechanisms\nprovides the capability for increased protection of individual system components and to\nmore effectively control information flows between those components.
