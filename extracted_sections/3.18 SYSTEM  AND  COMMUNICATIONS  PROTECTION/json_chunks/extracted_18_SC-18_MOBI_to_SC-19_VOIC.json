Decisions regarding the use of mobile code within organizational systems are based on\nthe potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously. Mobile code\ntechnologies include Java applets, JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL, and VBScript. Usage restrictions\nand implementation guidelines apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on\nservers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations and devices,\nincluding notebook computers and smart phones. Mobile code policy and procedures address\nspecific actions taken to prevent the development, acquisition, and introduction of unacceptable\nmobile code within organizational systems, including requiring mobile code to be digitally signed\nby a trusted source.\nRelated Controls:  AU-2, AU-12, CM-2, CM-6, SI-3.\nControl Enhancements: h\n| u(1) MOBILE CODE  IDENTIFY UNACCEPTABLE CODE AND TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS\nlicAssignment: organization-defined unacceptable mobile codeIdentify [] and take\niAssignment: organization-defined corrective actions[]. o\nisDiscussion:  Corrective actions when unacceptable mobile code is detected include blocking,\nvquarantine, or alerting administrators.
