Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network\nprotocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the\norigination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can\nhfilter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being\ndirectly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network p\nbcapacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to\ndenial-of-service events. a\nRelated Controls:  CP-2, IR-4, SC-6, SC-7, SC-40.\nvControl Enhancements:\nb--| (1) DENIALOFSERVICE PROTECTION  RESTRICT ABILITY TO ATTACK OTHER SYSTEMS\nf Restrict the ability of individuals to launchthe following denial-of-service attacks against r\nAssignment: organization-defined denial-of-service attacksother systems: [].\ncDiscussion:  Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial-of-service attacks requires\nthe mechanisms commonly used for such attacks to be unavailable. Individuals of concern r\ninclude hostile insiders or external adversaries who have breached or compromised the\nsystem and are using it to launch a denial-of-service attack. Organizations can restrict the  m\nability of individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary information on the transport medium\nt(i.e., wired networks, wireless networks, spoofed Internet protocol packets). Organizations p\n:can also limit the ability of individuals to use excessive system resources.

Denial-of-service\nattacks can originate from external or internal sources. System resources that are sensitive\nto denial of service include physical disk storage, memory, and CPU cycles. Techniques used\nto prevent denial-of-service attacks related to storage utilization and capacity include\ninstituting disk quotas, configuring systems to automatically alert administrators when\nspecific storage capacity thresholds are reached, using file compression technologies to\nmaximize available storage space, and imposing separate partitions for system and user\ndata.\nRelated Controls:  CA-7, SI-4.\nReferences:  [SP 800-189]."
