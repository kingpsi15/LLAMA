There\nare many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service,\nor spoof system users. Protection of wireless links reduces the impact of attacks that are unique\nto wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for transmission\nservices as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to\nimplement wireless link protections to the extent necessary to meet organizational security\nrequirements.\n.Related Controls:  AC-18, SC-5\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION  ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE\nAssignment: organization-defined Implement cryptographic mechanisms that achieve [\nlevel of protection] against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference. h\nDiscussion:  The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms for electromagnetic p\nbinterference protects systems against intentional jamming that might deny or impair\ncommunications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms used to provide anti-a\njam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals.
