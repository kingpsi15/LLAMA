Mobile\ndevices often include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment where T\nthe system is in use. Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include microphones,\n8cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While the sensors\non mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly, such devices can -\npotentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about individuals and\norganizations. For example, remotely activating the GPS function on a mobile device could\nprovide an adversary with the ability to track the movements of an individual. Organizations may\nprohibit individuals from bringing cellular telephones or digital cameras into certain designated\nfacilities or controlled areas within facilities where classified information is stored or sensitive\nconversations are taking place.\nRelated Controls:  SC-15.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA  REPORTING TO AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS OR ROLES\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 326\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nVerify that the system is configured so that data or information collected by the\nAssignment: organization-defined sensors[] is only reported to authorized individuals or\nroles.\nDiscussion:  In situations where sensors are activated by authorized individuals, it is still\npossible that the data or information collected by the sensors will be sent to unauthorized\nentities.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA  AUTHORIZED USE\nAssignment: Employ the following measures so that data or information collected by [\norganization-defined sensorsAssignment: ] is only used for authorized purposes: [\norganization-defined measures].\nTDiscussion:  Information collected by sensors for a specific authorized purpose could be\nimisused for some unauthorized purpose. For example, GPS sensors that are used to support s\nutraffic navigation could be misused to track the movements of individuals. Measures to\nlimitigate such activities include additional training to help ensure that authorized individuals c\ntdo not abuse their authority and, in the case where sensor data is maintained by external i\nparties, contractual restrictions on the use of such data.\nRelated Controls:  PT-2.\n| (3) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA  PROHIBIT USE OF DEVICESb\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-42.] f\n|o (4) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA  NOTICE OF COLLECTION\nhEmploy the following measures to facilitate an individual\u2019s awareness that personally\ngAssignment: organization-defined sensorsidentifiable information is being collected by []:\nfAssignment: organization-defined measures[].\nDiscussion:  Awareness that organizational sensors are collecting data enables individuals to\nmore effectively engage in managing their privacy. Measures can include conventional t\nswritten notices and sensor configurations that make individuals directly or indirectly aware\ndthrough other devices that the sensor is collecting information. The usability and efficacy of\nthe notice are important considerations. o\n/Related Controls:  PT-1, PT-4, PT-5. 1\n0| (5) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA  COLLECTION MINIMIZATION\n/Assignment: organization-defined sensorsEmploy [] that are configured to minimize the N\ncollection of information about individuals that is not needed.\nDiscussion:  Although policies to control for authorized use can be applied to information\n8once it is collected, minimizing the collection of information that is not needed mitigates\nprivacy risk at the system entry point and mitigates the risk of policy control failures. Sensor -\nconfigurations include the obscuring of human features, such as blurring or pixelating flesh\ntones.\nRelated Controls:  SA-8, SI-12.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-124]."
