The use of out-of-band channels is contrasted with the use of in-band\nichannels (i.e., the same channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels do o\nnot have the same vulnerability or exposure as in-band channels. Therefore, the confidentiality, is\nintegrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise or adversely affect\nthe out-of-band channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or i\ntransmission of organizational items, including authenticators and credentials; cryptographic key le\nfmanagement information; system and data backups; configuration management changes for r\nhardware, firmware, or software; security updates; maintenance information; and malicious\ncode protection updates.\nrRelated Controls:  AC-2, CM-3, CM-5, CM-7, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, MA-4, SC-12, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7. g\nrControl Enhancements: o\n--|(1)  hOUTOFBAND CHANNELS  ENSURE DELIVERY AND TRANSMISSION\nAssignment: organization-defined controlsAssignment: Employ [] to ensure that only [s\n/organization-defined individuals or systems] receive the following information, system d\niAssignment: organization-defined information, system components, or devices: [.\ngcomponents, or devices].\nDiscussion:  Techniques employed by organizations to ensure that only designated systems .\nor individuals receive certain information, system components, or devices include sending 2\n/authenticators via an approved courier service but requiring recipients to show some form N\nSof government-issued photographic identification as a condition of receipt.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n0References:  [SP 800-57-1], [SP 800-57-2], [SP 800-57-3]."
