The organization often only has a limited set of\nmonitoring and detection capabilities, and they may be focused on the critical or likely infiltration\nor exfiltration paths. By using communications paths that the organization typically does not\nmonitor, the adversary can increase its chances of achieving its desired goals. By relocating its\nsensors or monitoring capabilities to new locations, the organization can impede the adversary\u2019s\nability to achieve its goals. The relocation of the sensors or monitoring capabilities might be done\nhbased on threat information that the organization has acquired or randomly to confuse the\nadversary and make its lateral transition through the system or organization more challenging.  p\nliRelated Controls:  AU-2, SC-7, SI-4. c\nControl Enhancements:\n| a(1) SENSOR RELOCATION  DYNAMIC RELOCATION OF SENSORS OR MONITORING CAPABILITIES\niAssignment: organization-defined sensors and monitoring Dynamically relocate [la\ncapabilitiesAssignment: organization-defined locations] to [] under the following le\nfAssignment: organization-defined conditions or conditions or circumstances: [r\ncircumstances].\ncDiscussion:  None.\nRelated Controls:  None. g\nReferences:  [SP 800-160-2]. o"
