Changing virtual operating systems\nor applications, as opposed to changing actual operating systems or applications, provides p\nbvirtual changes that impede attacker success while reducing configuration management\nefforts. Virtualization techniques can assist in isolating untrustworthy software or software a\nof dubious provenance into confined execution environments.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None.i la"
