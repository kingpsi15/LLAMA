The redundancy and\neoverlap increase the work factor of adversaries to adversely impact organizational operations,\noassets, and individuals. The use of distributed processing and storage does not assume a single\nprimary processing or storage location. Therefore, it allows for parallel processing and storage. :\nRelated Controls:  CP-6, CP-7, PL-8, SC-32. s\nControl Enhancements: o\ng| (1) DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE  POLLING TECHNIQUES\n(a)Employ polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to the  .\nAssignment: organization-defined following processing and storage components: [2\n/distributed processing and storage components]; and N\n(b)Take the following actions in response to identified faults, errors, or compromises:  T\nAssignment: organization-definedactions[ ].\nDiscussion:  Distributed processing and/or storage may be used to reduce opportunities for 0\n-adversaries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of organizational\ninformation and systems. However, the distribution of processing and storage components r\ndoes not prevent adversaries from compromising one or more of the components. Polling\ncompares the processing results and/or storage content from the distributed components\nand subsequently votes on the outcomes. Polling identifies potential faults, compromises, or\nerrors in the distributed processing and storage components.\nRelated Controls:  SI-4.\n| (2) DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE  SYNCHRONIZATION\nAssignment: Synchronize the following duplicate systems or system components: [\norganization-defined duplicate systems or system components].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 322\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  SC-36 and CP-9(6) require the duplication of systems or system components in\ndistributed locations. The synchronization of duplicated and redundant services and data\nhelps to ensure that information contained in the distributed locations can be used in the\nmission or business functions of organizations, as needed.\nRelated Controls:  CP-9.\nReferences:  [SP 800-160-2]."
