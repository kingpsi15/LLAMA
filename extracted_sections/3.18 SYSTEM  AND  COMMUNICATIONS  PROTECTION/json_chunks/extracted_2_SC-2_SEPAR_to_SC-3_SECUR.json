  "content": "SC-2 SEPARATION OF SYSTEM AND USER FUNCTIONALITY\nControl:  Separate user functionality, including user interface services, from system management\nfunctionality.\nDiscussion:  System management functionality includes functions that are necessary to\nadminister databases, network components, workstations, or servers. These functions typically\nrequire privileged user access. The separation of user functions from system management\nfunctions is physical or logical. Organizations may separate system management functions from\nuser functions by using different computers, instances of operating systems, central processing\nunits, or network addresses; by employing virtualization techniques; or some combination of\nthese or other methods. Separation of system management functions from user functions\nincludes web administrative interfaces that employ separate authentication methods for users of\nany other system resources. Separation of system and user functions may include isolating\nhadministrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls. The\nseparation of system and user functionality can be achieved by applying the systems security p\nbSA-8, including SA-8(1), SA-8(3), SA-8(4), SA-8(10), SA-8(12), SA-engineering design principles in\na8(13), SA-8(14), and SA-8(18).\nRelated Controls:  AC-6, SA-4, SA-8, SC-3, SC-7, SC-22, SC-32, SC-39.\nvControl Enhancements:\nb|- (1) SEPARATION OF SYSTEM AND USER FUNCTIONALITY  INTERFACES FOR NONPRIVILEGED USERS\nPrevent the presentation of system management functionality at interfaces to non-r\nprivileged users.\ncDiscussion:  Preventing the presentation of system management functionality at interfaces\nto non-privileged users ensures that system administration options, including administrator r\nprivileges, are not available to the general user population. Restricting user access also\nprohibits the use of the grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such  m\ninformation. One potential solution is to withhold system administration options until users\ntestablish sessions with administrator privileges. p\n/Related Controls:  AC-3.\no| (2) SEPARATION OF SYSTEM AND USER FUNCTIONALITY  DISASSOCIABILITYr\n1  Store state information from applications and softwareseparately.\nDiscussion:  If a system is compromised, storing applications and software separately from 0\nstate information about users\u2019 interactions with an application may better protect\nIindividuals\u2019 privacy.\n.Related Controls:  None.
