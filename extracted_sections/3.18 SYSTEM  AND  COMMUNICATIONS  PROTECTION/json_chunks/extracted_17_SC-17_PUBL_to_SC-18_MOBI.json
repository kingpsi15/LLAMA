In cryptographic systems with a hierarchical structure, a trust\n8anchor is an authoritative source (i.e., a certificate authority) for which trust is assumed and not\nderived. A root certificate for a PKI system is an example of a trust anchor. A trust store or\ncertificate store maintains a list of trusted root certificates.\nRelated Controls:  AU-10, IA-5, SC-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [SP 800-32], [SP 800-57-1], [SP 800-57-2], [SP 800-57-3], [SP 800-63-3]."
