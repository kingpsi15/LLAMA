It can e\nalso include certain applications that run directly on hardware platforms. Hardware-enforced,\nhread-only media include Compact Disc-Recordable (CD-R) and Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable\n(DVD-R) disk drives as well as one-time, programmable, read-only memory. The use of non-g\nmodifiable storage ensures the integrity of software from the point of creation of the read-only f\nmimage. The use of reprogrammable, read-only memory can be accepted as read-only media\nhprovided that integrity can be adequately protected from the point of initial writing to the\ninsertion of the memory into the system, and there are reliable hardware protections against s\n/reprogramming the memory while installed in organizational systems. d\noRelated Controls:  AC-3, SI-7, SI-14.\nControl Enhancements: 0\n2-| (1) NONMODIFIABLE EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS  NO WRITABLE STORAGE\nAssignment: organization-defined system componentsEmploy [] with no writeable storage I\nTthat is persistent across component restart or power on/off.\nDiscussion:  Disallowing writeable storage eliminates the possibility of malicious code\n0insertion via persistent, writeable storage within the designated system components. The\n5restriction applies to fixed and removable storage, with the latter being addressed either\ndirectly or as specific restrictions imposed through access controls for mobile devices. 5\nRelated Controls:  AC-19, MP-7.\n-|- (2) NONMODIFIABLE EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS  INTEGRITY PROTECTION ON READONLY MEDIA\nProtect the integrity of information prior to storage on read-only media and control the\nmedia after such information has been recorded onto the media.\nDiscussion:  Controls prevent the substitution of media into systems or the reprogramming\nof programmable read-only media prior to installation into the systems. Integrity protection\ncontrols include a combination of prevention, detection, and response.\nRelated Controls:  CM-3, CM-5, CM-9, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, SC-28, SI-3.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 321\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n-|- (3) NONMODIFIABLE EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS  HARDWAREBASED PROTECTION\n[Withdrawn: Moved to SC-51.]"
