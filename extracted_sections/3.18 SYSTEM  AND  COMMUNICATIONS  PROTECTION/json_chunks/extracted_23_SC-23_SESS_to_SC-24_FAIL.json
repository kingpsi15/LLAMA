  "content": "NSC-23 SESSION AUTHENTICITY\nControl:  Protect the authenticity of communications sessions. .\n8Discussion:  Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session\nlevel, not at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of\n3communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and the validity of transmitted\ninformation. Authenticity protection includes protecting against \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attacks,\nsession hijacking, and the insertion of false information into sessions.\nRelated Controls:  AU-10, SC-8, SC-10, SC-11.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SESSION AUTHENTICITY  INVALIDATE SESSION IDENTIFIERS AT LOGOUT\nInvalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.\nDiscussion:  Invalidating session identifiers at logout curtails the ability of adversaries to\ncapture and continue to employ previously valid session IDs.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 314\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|-  (2) SESSION AUTHENTICITY  USERINITIATED LOGOUTS AND MESSAGE DISPLAYS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-12(1).]\n|- (3) SESSION AUTHENTICITY  UNIQUE SYSTEMGENERATED SESSION IDENTIFIERS\nAssignment: organization-Generate a unique session identifier for each session with [\ndefined randomness requirements] and recognize only session identifiers that are system-\ngenerated.\nDiscussion:  Generating unique session identifiers curtails the ability of adversaries to reuse\npreviously valid session IDs.
