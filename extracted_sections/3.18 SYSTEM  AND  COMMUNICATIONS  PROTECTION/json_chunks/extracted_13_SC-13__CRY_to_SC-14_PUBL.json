Cryptography can also be used to support random number and hash generation.\nGenerally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-\napproved cryptography. For example, organizations that need to protect classified information\nmay specify the use of NSA-approved cryptography. Organizations that need to provision and\nimplement digital signatures may specify the use of FIPS-validated cryptography. Cryptography is\nimplemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, T\nipolicies, standards, and guidelines. s\nbRelated Controls:  AC-2, AC-3, AC-7, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AU-9, AU-10, CM-11, CP-9, IA-3, IA-5,\nIA-7, MA-4, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, SA-4, SA-8, SA-9, SC-8, SC-12, SC-20, SC-23, SC-28, SC-40, SI-3, SI-a\nControl Enhancements:  None. a\nl|- (1) CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION  FIPSVALIDATED CRYPTOGRAPHY a\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-13.]\n|- (2) CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION  NSAAPPROVED CRYPTOGRAPHY\nc[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-13.]\n| (3) CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION  INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT FORMAL ACCESS APPROVALS e\no[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-13.]\nh| (4) CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION  DIGITAL SIGNATURES\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-13.] :\nReferences:  [FIPS 140-3]. i."
