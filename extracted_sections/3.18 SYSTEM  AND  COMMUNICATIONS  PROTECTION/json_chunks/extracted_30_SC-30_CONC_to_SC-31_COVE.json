For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations with the :\nability to disguise systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the o\nocost of having multiple platforms.

Such actions may\nimpede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations\nthat support critical missions or business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries\nto hesitate before initiating or continuing attacks.

The static, homogeneous, and deterministic nature of\norganizational systems targeted by adversaries make such systems more susceptible to\nattacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful. Changing processing and storage\nlocations (also referred to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced persistent is\nthreat using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This\nenables organizations to relocate the system components (i.e., processing, storage) that lic\nsupport critical mission and business functions. Changing the locations of processing t\nnactivities and/or storage sites introduces a degree of uncertainty into the targeting activities\nof adversaries. The targeting uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries and makes\ncompromises or breaches of the organizational systems more difficult and time-consuming. a\nIt also increases the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose certain aspects of\ntheir tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational resources.\nRelated Controls:  None.e\nc| (4) CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION  MISLEADING INFORMATION\nAssignment: organization-defined system Employ realistic, but misleading information in [g\ncomponents] about its security state or posture. f\nDiscussion:  Employing misleading information is intended to confuse potential adversaries\nregarding the nature and extent of controls deployed by organizations. Thus, adversaries t\nsmay employ incorrect and ineffective attack techniques. One technique for misleading\ndadversaries is for organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific\ni.controls deployed in external systems that are known to be targeted by adversaries. Another o\ntechnique is the use of deception nets that mimic actual aspects of organizational systems\nbut use, for example, out-of-date software configurations.\n2Related Controls:  None.\n|I (5) CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION  CONCEALMENT OF SYSTEM COMPONENTSS\n.Assignment: organization-defined Employ the following techniques to hide or conceal [S\nsystem componentsAssignment: organization-defined techniques]: []. .\nDiscussion:  By hiding, disguising, or concealing critical system components, organizations\n3may be able to decrease the probability that adversaries target and successfully compromise\nthose assets. Potential means to hide, disguise, or conceal system components include the\nconfiguration of routers or the use of encryption or virtualization techniques.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None."
