The risk management i.\nstrategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and g\nprocedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security 0\nand privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and communications protection 0\n8policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization\nlevel are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies I\nand procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or\nPbe represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures\ncan be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for 0\n-systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can 5\nrbe directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be 5\ndocumented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events\nthat may precipitate an update to system and communications protection policy and procedures\ninclude assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply\nrestating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-100].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 292\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
