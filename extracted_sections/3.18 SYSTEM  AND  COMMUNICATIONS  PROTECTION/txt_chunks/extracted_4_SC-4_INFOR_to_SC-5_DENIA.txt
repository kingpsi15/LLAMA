aSC-4 INFORMATION IN SHARED SYSTEM RESOURCES
Control:  Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system
aresources.
lDiscussion:  Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system a
leresources stops information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or the actions of
processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles e
(or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared o
csystem resources after those resources have been released back to the system. Information in
shared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other r
contexts, control of information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and
residual information protection. Information in shared system resources does not address  m
information remanence, which refers to the residual representation of data that has been
tnominally deleted; covert channels (including storage and timing channels), where shared system p
:resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within /
osystems for which there are only single users or roles.

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-4.]
| (2) INFORMATION IN SHARED SYSTEM RESOURCES  MULTILEVEL OR PERIODS PROCESSING
0Prevent unauthorized information transfer via shared resources in accordance with
Assignment: organization-defined procedures[] when system processing explicitly switches 3
between different information classification levels or security categories.
Discussion:  Changes in processing levels can occur during multilevel or periods processing
with information at different classification levels or security categories. It can also occur
during serial reuse of hardware components at different classification levels. Organization-
defined procedures can include approved sanitization processes for electronically stored
information.
