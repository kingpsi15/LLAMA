SC-15 COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS
Control:
0a.Prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices and applications with the
3Assignment: organization-defined exceptions where remote activation following exceptions: [
is to be allowed ]; and
b.Provide an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.
Discussion:  Collaborative computing devices and applications include remote meeting devices
and applications, networked white boards, cameras, and microphones. The explicit indication of
use includes signals to users when collaborative computing devices and applications are
activated.
Related Controls:  AC-21, SC-42.

Selection (one or more): physical; logicalProvide [] disconnect of collaborative computing
devices in a manner that supports ease of use.
Discussion:  Failing to disconnect from collaborative computing devices can result in
subsequent compromises of organizational information. Providing easy methods to
disconnect from such devices after a collaborative computing session ensures that
participants carry out the disconnect activity without having to go through complex and
