5SC-32 SYSTEM PARTITIONING
Assignment: organization-defined system componentsControl:  Partition the system into []
Selection: physical; logicalAssignment: residing in separate [] domains or environments based on [
organization-defined circumstances for physical or logical separation of components].
Discussion:  System partitioning is part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy. Organizations
determine the degree of physical separation of system components. Physical separation options
include physically distinct components in separate racks in the same room, critical components in
separate rooms, and geographical separation of critical components. Security categorization can
guide the selection of candidates for domain partitioning. Managed interfaces restrict or prohibit
network access and information flow among partitioned system components.

| (1) SYSTEM PARTITIONING  SEPARATE PHYSICAL DOMAINS FOR PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS
Partition privileged functions into separate physical domains.
Discussion:  Privileged functions that operate in a single physical domain may represent a
single point of failure if that domain becomes compromised or experiences a denial of
service.
Related Controls:  None.
