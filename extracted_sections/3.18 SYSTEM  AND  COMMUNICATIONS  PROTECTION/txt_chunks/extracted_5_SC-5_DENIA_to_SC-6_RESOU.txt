Assignment: b.Employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective: [
organization-defined controls by type of denial-of-service event].
Discussion:  Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes,
such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support organizational needs with
respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network
protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the
origination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can
hfilter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being
directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network p
bcapacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to
denial-of-service events. a

cDiscussion:  Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial-of-service attacks requires
the mechanisms commonly used for such attacks to be unavailable. Individuals of concern r
include hostile insiders or external adversaries who have breached or compromised the
system and are using it to launch a denial-of-service attack. Organizations can restrict the  m
ability of individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary information on the transport medium
t(i.e., wired networks, wireless networks, spoofed Internet protocol packets). Organizations p
:can also limit the ability of individuals to use excessive system resources. Protection against /
oindividuals having the ability to launch denial-of-service attacks may be implemented on
specific systems or boundary devices that prohibit egress to potential target systems. r

Discussion:  Organizations consider the utilization and capacity of system resources when
managing risk associated with a denial of service due to malicious attacks. Denial-of-service
attacks can originate from external or internal sources. System resources that are sensitive
to denial of service include physical disk storage, memory, and CPU cycles. Techniques used
to prevent denial-of-service attacks related to storage utilization and capacity include
instituting disk quotas, configuring systems to automatically alert administrators when
specific storage capacity thresholds are reached, using file compression technologies to
maximize available storage space, and imposing separate partitions for system and user
data.
