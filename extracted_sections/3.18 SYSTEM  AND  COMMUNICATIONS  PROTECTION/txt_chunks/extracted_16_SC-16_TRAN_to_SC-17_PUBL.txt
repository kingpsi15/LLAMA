NSC-16 TRANSMISSION OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES
Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy attributesControl:  Associate [] with .
information exchanged between systems and between system components.
Discussion:  Security and privacy attributes can be explicitly or implicitly associated with the
3information contained in organizational systems or system components. Attributes are
abstractions that represent the basic properties or characteristics of an entity with respect to
protecting information or the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes are
typically associated with internal data structures, including records, buffers, and files within the
system. Security and privacy attributes are used to implement access control and information
flow control policies; reflect special dissemination, management, or distribution instructions,
including permitted uses of personally identifiable information; or support other aspects of the
information security and privacy policies. Privacy attributes may be used independently or in
conjunction with security attributes.

| (1) TRANSMISSION OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
Verify the integrity of transmitted security and privacy attributes.
Discussion:  Part of verifying the integrity of transmitted information is ensuring that security
and privacy attributes that are associated with such information have not been modified in
an unauthorized manner. Unauthorized modification of security or privacy attributes can
result in a loss of integrity for transmitted information.
Related Controls:  AU-10, SC-8.
|- (2) TRANSMISSION OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES  ANTISPOOFING MECHANISMS
Implement anti-spoofing mechanisms to prevent adversaries from falsifying the security
attributes indicating the successful application of the security process.
Discussion:  Some attack vectors operate by altering the security attributes of an information
system to intentionally and maliciously implement an insufficient level of security within the h
system. The alteration of attributes leads organizations to believe that a greater number of
security functions are in place and operational than have actually been implemented. b

eprivacy attribute binding to transmitted information to help ensure the integrity of such
