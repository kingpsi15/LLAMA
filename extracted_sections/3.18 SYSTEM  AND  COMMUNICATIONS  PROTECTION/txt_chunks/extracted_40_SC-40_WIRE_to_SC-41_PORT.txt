exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There
are many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service,
or spoof system users. Protection of wireless links reduces the impact of attacks that are unique
to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for transmission
services as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be possible to
implement wireless link protections to the extent necessary to meet organizational security
requirements.

Assignment: organization-defined Implement cryptographic mechanisms that achieve [
level of protection] against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference. h
Discussion:  The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms for electromagnetic p
binterference protects systems against intentional jamming that might deny or impair
communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms used to provide anti-a
jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. The implementation of
iscryptographic mechanisms may also coincidentally mitigate the effects of unintentional
vjamming due to interference from legitimate transmitters that share the same spectrum.

is used for covert communications and to protect wireless transmitters from geo-location. It
/also ensures that the spread spectrum waveforms used to achieve a low probability of

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to identify and reject wireless transmissions that .
are deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications deception
0based on signal parameters.
Discussion:  The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms to identify and reject 3
imitative or manipulative communications ensures that the signal parameters of wireless
transmissions are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Such unpredictability reduces
the probability of imitative or manipulative communications deception based on signal
parameters alone.

to signal parameters are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. It also provides
anonymity when required. Radio fingerprinting techniques identify the unique signal
parameters of transmitters to fingerprint such transmitters for purposes of tracking and
mission or user identification.
