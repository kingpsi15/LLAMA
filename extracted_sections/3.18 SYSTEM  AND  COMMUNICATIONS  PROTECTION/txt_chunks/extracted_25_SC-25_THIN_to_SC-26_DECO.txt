Discussion:  The deployment of system components with minimal functionality reduces the need
to secure every endpoint and may reduce the exposure of information, systems, and services to
attacks. Reduced or minimal functionality includes diskless nodes and thin client technologies.
Related Controls:  SC-30, SC-44.
Control Enhancements:  None.
