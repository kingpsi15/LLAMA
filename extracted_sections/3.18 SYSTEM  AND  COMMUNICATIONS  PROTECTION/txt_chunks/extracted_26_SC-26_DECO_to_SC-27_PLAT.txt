SC-26 DECOYS
Control:  Include components within organizational systems specifically designed to be the target
of malicious attacks for detecting, deflecting, and analyzing such attacks.
Discussion:  Decoys (i.e., honeypots, honeynets, or deception nets) are established to attract T
iadversaries and deflect attacks away from the operational systems that support organizational s
mission and business functions. Use of decoys requires some supporting isolation measures to u
lensure that any deflected malicious code does not infect organizational systems. Depending on ic
tthe specific usage of the decoy, consultation with the Office of the General Counsel before i
deployment may be needed.
vRelated Controls:  RA-5, SC-7, SC-30, SC-35, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4.
