SC-8 TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY 3
Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrityControl:  Protect the [] of transmitted
information.
Discussion:  Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information applies to
internal and external networks as well as any system components that can transmit information,
including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, mobile devices, printers, copiers,
scanners, facsimile machines, and radios. Unprotected communication paths are exposed to the
possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of
information can be accomplished by physical or logical means. Physical protection can be
achieved by using protected distribution systems. A protected distribution system is a wireline or
fiber-optics telecommunications system that includes terminals and adequate electromagnetic,

acoustical, electrical, and physical controls to permit its use for the unencrypted transmission of
classified information. Logical protection can be achieved by employing encryption techniques.
Organizations that rely on commercial providers who offer transmission services as commodity
services rather than as fully dedicated services may find it difficult to obtain the necessary
assurances regarding the implementation of needed controls for transmission confidentiality and
integrity. In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality or integrity
services are available in standard, commercial telecommunications service packages. If it is not
feasible to obtain the necessary controls and assurances of control effectiveness through
appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations can implement appropriate compensating
controls.

Discussion:  Encryption protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification a
aduring transmission. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality and integrity
bof information during transmission include TLS and IPSec. Cryptographic mechanisms used to
protect information integrity include cryptographic hash functions that have applications in
digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. e

Discussion:  Cryptographic protection for message externals addresses protection from the 0
-unauthorized disclosure of information. Message externals include message headers and 5
rrouting information. Cryptographic protection prevents the exploitation of message
externals and applies to internal and external networks or links that may be visible to
individuals who are not authorized users. Header and routing information is sometimes
transmitted in clear text (i.e., unencrypted) because the information is not identified by
organizations as having significant value or because encrypting the information can result in
lower network performance or higher costs. Alternative physical controls include protected
distribution systems.

Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical unless otherwise protected by [
controls].
Discussion:  Concealing or randomizing communication patterns addresses protection from
unauthorized disclosure of information. Communication patterns include frequency, periods,
predictability, and amount. Changes to communications patterns can reveal information
with intelligence value, especially when combined with other available information related
to the mission and business functions of the organization. Concealing or randomizing
communications prevents the derivation of intelligence based on communications patterns
and applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals
who are not authorized users. Encrypting the links and transmitting in continuous, fixed, or
random patterns prevents the derivation of intelligence from the system communications
patterns. Alternative physical controls include protected distribution systems.
