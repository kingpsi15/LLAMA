NSC-23 SESSION AUTHENTICITY
Control:  Protect the authenticity of communications sessions. .
8Discussion:  Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session
level, not at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of
3communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and the validity of transmitted
information. Authenticity protection includes protecting against “man-in-the-middle” attacks,
session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into sessions.

Control Enhancements:
| (1) SESSION AUTHENTICITY  INVALIDATE SESSION IDENTIFIERS AT LOGOUT
Invalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.
Discussion:  Invalidating session identifiers at logout curtails the ability of adversaries to
capture and continue to employ previously valid session IDs.

|- (3) SESSION AUTHENTICITY  UNIQUE SYSTEMGENERATED SESSION IDENTIFIERS
Assignment: organization-Generate a unique session identifier for each session with [
defined randomness requirements] and recognize only session identifiers that are system-
generated.
Discussion:  Generating unique session identifiers curtails the ability of adversaries to reuse
previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the generation of
unique session identifiers protects against brute-force attacks to determine future session
identifiers.

Assignment: organization-defined certificate authoritiesOnly allow the use of [] for
iverification of the establishment of protected sessions. la
lDiscussion:  Reliance on certificate authorities for the establishment of secure sessions e
rincludes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. These certificates, after e
verification by their respective certificate authorities, facilitate the establishment of o
cprotected sessions between web clients and web servers.
