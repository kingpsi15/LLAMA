SC-36 DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE v
Selection: Control:  Distribute the following processing and storage components across multiple [b
physical locations; logical domainsAssignment: organization-defined processing and storage ]: [
components]. e
Discussion:  Distributing processing and storage across multiple physical locations or logical c
adomains provides a degree of redundancy or overlap for organizations. The redundancy and
eoverlap increase the work factor of adversaries to adversely impact organizational operations,
oassets, and individuals. The use of distributed processing and storage does not assume a single
primary processing or storage location. Therefore, it allows for parallel processing and storage. :

Assignment: organization-definedactions[ ].
Discussion:  Distributed processing and/or storage may be used to reduce opportunities for 0
-adversaries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of organizational
information and systems. However, the distribution of processing and storage components r
does not prevent adversaries from compromising one or more of the components. Polling
compares the processing results and/or storage content from the distributed components
and subsequently votes on the outcomes. Polling identifies potential faults, compromises, or
errors in the distributed processing and storage components.

Discussion:  SC-36 and CP-9(6) require the duplication of systems or system components in
distributed locations. The synchronization of duplicated and redundant services and data
helps to ensure that information contained in the distributed locations can be used in the
mission or business functions of organizations, as needed.
