SC-44 DETONATION CHAMBERS
i  Assignment: organization-defined Control:Employ a detonation chamber capability within [s
system, system component, or location]. u
Discussion:  Detonation chambers, also known as dynamic execution environments, allow a
organizations to open email attachments, execute untrusted or suspicious applications, and
iexecute Universal Resource Locator requests in the safety of an isolated environment or a s
virtualized sandbox. Protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of v
ldetermining whether the associated attachments or applications contain malicious code. While a
lrelated to the concept of deception nets, the employment of detonation chambers is not e
rintended to maintain a long-term environment in which adversaries can operate and their e
actions can be observed. Rather, detonation chambers are intended to quickly identify malicious
ccode and either reduce the likelihood that the code is propagated to user environments of
operation or prevent such propagation completely.
