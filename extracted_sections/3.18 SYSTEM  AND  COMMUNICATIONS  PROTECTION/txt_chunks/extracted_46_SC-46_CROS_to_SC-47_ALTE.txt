lSelection: physically; logicallyControl:  Implement a policy enforcement mechanism [] between a
lethe physical and/or network interfaces for the connecting security domains.
eDiscussion:  For logical policy enforcement mechanisms, organizations avoid creating a logical
fpath between interfaces to prevent the ability to bypass the policy enforcement mechanism. For
physical policy enforcement mechanisms, the robustness of physical isolation afforded by the
gphysical implementation of policy enforcement to preclude the presence of logical covert
