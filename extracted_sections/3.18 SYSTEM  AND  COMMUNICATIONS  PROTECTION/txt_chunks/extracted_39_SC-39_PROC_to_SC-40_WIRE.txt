SC-39 PROCESS ISOLATION T
Control:  Maintain a separate execution domain for each executing system process. p
lDiscussion:  Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by ic
tassigning each process a separate address space. Each system process has a distinct address i
space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through
the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. a
aMaintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example,
by implementing separate address spaces. Process isolation technologies, including sandboxing b
or virtualization, logically separate software and firmware from other software, firmware, and
data. Process isolation helps limit the access of potentially untrusted software to other system e
resources. The capability to maintain separate execution domains is available in commercial f
hoperating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.

/Implement hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate process isolation.
i.Discussion:  Hardware-based separation of system processes is generally less susceptible to
compromise than software-based separation, thus providing greater assurance that the
0separation will be enforced. Hardware separation mechanisms include hardware memory
