Discussion:  Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users can communicate (using input devices
such as keyboards) directly with the security functions of systems with the requisite assurance to
support security policies. Trusted path mechanisms can only be activated by users or the security
functions of organizational systems. User responses that occur via trusted paths are protected
from modification by and disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ trusted
paths for trustworthy, high-assurance connections between security functions of systems and
users, including during system logons. The original implementations of trusted paths employed
an out-of-band signal to initiate the path, such as using the <BREAK> key, which does not
transmit characters that can be spoofed. In later implementations, a key combination that could
not be hijacked was used (e.g., the <CTRL> + <ALT> + <DEL> keys). Such key combinations, T
ihowever, are platform-specific and may not provide a trusted path implementation in every case. s
The enforcement of trusted communications paths is provided by a specific implementation that u
lmeets the reference monitor concept. ic

Discussion:  An irrefutable communications path permits the system to initiate a trusted path, e
rwhich necessitates that the user can unmistakably recognize the source of the communication as o
a trusted system component. For example, the trusted path may appear in an area of the display :
tthat other applications cannot access or be based on the presence of an identifier that cannot be
spoofed.
