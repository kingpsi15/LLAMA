Discussion:  Mobile code includes any program, application, or content that can be transmitted
across a network (e.g., embedded in an email, document, or website) and executed on a remote
system. Decisions regarding the use of mobile code within organizational systems are based on
the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously. Mobile code
technologies include Java applets, JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL, and VBScript. Usage restrictions
and implementation guidelines apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on
servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations and devices,
including notebook computers and smart phones. Mobile code policy and procedures address
specific actions taken to prevent the development, acquisition, and introduction of unacceptable
mobile code within organizational systems, including requiring mobile code to be digitally signed
by a trusted source.

Discussion:  Actions enforced before executing mobile code include prompting users prior to
opening email attachments or clicking on web links. Preventing the automatic execution of
mobile code includes disabling auto-execute features on system components that employ
portable storage devices, such as compact discs, digital versatile discs, and universal serial
bus devices.
Related Controls:  None.

Allow execution of permitted mobile code only in confined virtual machine environments.

Discussion:  Permitting the execution of mobile code only in confined virtual machine
environments helps prevent the introduction of malicious code into other systems and
system components.
