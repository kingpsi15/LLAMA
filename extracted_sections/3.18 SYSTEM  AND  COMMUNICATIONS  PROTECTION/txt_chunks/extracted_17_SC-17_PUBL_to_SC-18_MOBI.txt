NDiscussion:  Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates are certificates with visibility external to
organizational systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems, such as T
application-specific time services. In cryptographic systems with a hierarchical structure, a trust
8anchor is an authoritative source (i.e., a certificate authority) for which trust is assumed and not
derived. A root certificate for a PKI system is an example of a trust anchor. A trust store or
certificate store maintains a list of trusted root certificates.
