Discussion:  Sensor capability and data applies to types of systems or system components
characterized as mobile devices, such as cellular telephones, smart phones, and tablets. Mobile
devices often include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment where T
the system is in use. Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include microphones,
8cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While the sensors
on mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly, such devices can -
potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about individuals and
organizations. For example, remotely activating the GPS function on a mobile device could
provide an adversary with the ability to track the movements of an individual. Organizations may
prohibit individuals from bringing cellular telephones or digital cameras into certain designated
facilities or controlled areas within facilities where classified information is stored or sensitive
conversations are taking place.

Verify that the system is configured so that data or information collected by the

roles.
Discussion:  In situations where sensors are activated by authorized individuals, it is still
possible that the data or information collected by the sensors will be sent to unauthorized
entities.
Related Controls:  None.

Assignment: Employ the following measures so that data or information collected by [

organization-defined measures].
TDiscussion:  Information collected by sensors for a specific authorized purpose could be
imisused for some unauthorized purpose. For example, GPS sensors that are used to support s
utraffic navigation could be misused to track the movements of individuals. Measures to
limitigate such activities include additional training to help ensure that authorized individuals c
tdo not abuse their authority and, in the case where sensor data is maintained by external i
parties, contractual restrictions on the use of such data.

Discussion:  Awareness that organizational sensors are collecting data enables individuals to
more effectively engage in managing their privacy. Measures can include conventional t
swritten notices and sensor configurations that make individuals directly or indirectly aware
dthrough other devices that the sensor is collecting information. The usability and efficacy of
the notice are important considerations. o

collection of information about individuals that is not needed.
Discussion:  Although policies to control for authorized use can be applied to information
8once it is collected, minimizing the collection of information that is not needed mitigates
privacy risk at the system entry point and mitigates the risk of policy control failures. Sensor -
configurations include the obscuring of human features, such as blurring or pixelating flesh
tones.
