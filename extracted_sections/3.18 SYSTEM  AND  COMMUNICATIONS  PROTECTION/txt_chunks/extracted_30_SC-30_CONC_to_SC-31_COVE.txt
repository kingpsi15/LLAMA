techniques]. f
Discussion:  Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the targeting :
tcapabilities of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate t
and complete attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations with the :
ability to disguise systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the o
ocost of having multiple platforms. The increased use of concealment and misdirection techniques
/and methods—including randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization—may sufficiently confuse
.and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing
tradecraft. Concealment and misdirection techniques may provide additional time to perform 2
/core mission and business functions. The implementation of concealment and misdirection N
techniques may add to the complexity and management overhead required for the system.

Assignment: organization-defined techniquesEmploy [] to introduce randomness into
organizational operations and assets.
Discussion:  Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries regarding
the actions that organizations take to defend their systems against attacks. Such actions may
impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations
that support critical missions or business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries
to hesitate before initiating or continuing attacks. Misdirection techniques that involve

Selection:Assignment: organization-defined time frequency; at random time intervals[ []]].
Discussion:  Adversaries target critical mission and business functions and the systems that
support those mission and business functions while also trying to minimize the exposure of
their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and deterministic nature of
organizational systems targeted by adversaries make such systems more susceptible to
attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful. Changing processing and storage
locations (also referred to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced persistent is
threat using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This
enables organizations to relocate the system components (i.e., processing, storage) that lic
support critical mission and business functions. Changing the locations of processing t
nactivities and/or storage sites introduces a degree of uncertainty into the targeting activities
of adversaries. The targeting uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries and makes
compromises or breaches of the organizational systems more difficult and time-consuming. a
It also increases the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose certain aspects of
their tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational resources.

Assignment: organization-defined system Employ realistic, but misleading information in [g
components] about its security state or posture. f
Discussion:  Employing misleading information is intended to confuse potential adversaries
regarding the nature and extent of controls deployed by organizations. Thus, adversaries t
smay employ incorrect and ineffective attack techniques. One technique for misleading
dadversaries is for organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific
i.controls deployed in external systems that are known to be targeted by adversaries. Another o
technique is the use of deception nets that mimic actual aspects of organizational systems
but use, for example, out-of-date software configurations.

Discussion:  By hiding, disguising, or concealing critical system components, organizations
3may be able to decrease the probability that adversaries target and successfully compromise
those assets. Potential means to hide, disguise, or conceal system components include the
configuration of routers or the use of encryption or virtualization techniques.
