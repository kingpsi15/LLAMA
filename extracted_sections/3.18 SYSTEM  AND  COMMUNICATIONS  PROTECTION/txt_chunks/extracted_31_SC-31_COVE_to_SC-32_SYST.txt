a.Perform a covert channel analysis to identify those aspects of communications within the
Selection (one or more): storage; timingsystem that are potential avenues for covert []
channels; and
b.Estimate the maximum bandwidth of those channels.
Discussion:  Developers are in the best position to identify potential areas within systems that
might lead to covert channels. Covert channel analysis is a meaningful activity when there is the
potential for unauthorized information flows across security domains, such as in the case of
systems that contain export-controlled information and have connections to external networks
(i.e., networks that are not controlled by organizations). Covert channel analysis is also useful for
multilevel secure systems, multiple security level systems, and cross-domain systems.

helps organizations determine how much information can be covertly leaked before such /
leakage adversely affects mission or business functions. Covert channel bandwidth may be .
