SC-7  BOUNDARY PROTECTION
Control:  :
pa.Monitor and control communications at the external managed interfaces to the system and
at key internal managed interfaces within the system; /
oSelection: b.Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [
physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and /
c.Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of  0

privacy architecture. I
SDiscussion:  Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based
.malicious code analysis, virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a
0security architecture. Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal
networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces 3
within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers
within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal
SP addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses. [
800-189] provides additional information on source address validation techniques to prevent
ingress and egress of traffic with spoofed addresses. Commercial telecommunications services
are provided by network components and consolidated management systems shared by
customers. These services may also include third party-provided access lines and other service
elements. Such services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security
provisions. Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an
organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific
boundary (i.e., an authorization boundary).

Limit the number of external network connections to the system.
Discussion:  Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates monitoring of
inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet Connection [DHS TIC]
pinitiative is an example of a federal guideline that requires limits on the number of external
network connections. Limiting the number of external network connections to the system is  lic
important during transition periods from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning
from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). Such transitions may require implementing the older n
and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the
number of access points to the system. a

| (7) BOUNDARY PROTECTION  SPLIT TUNNELING FOR REMOTE DEVICES
Prevent split tunneling for remote devices connecting to organizational systems unless the
Assignment: organization-defined safeguardssplit tunnel is securely provisioned using [].
Discussion:  Split tunneling is the process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a
non-remote connection with a system and simultaneously communicate via some other
connection to a resource in an external network. This method of network access enables a
huser to access remote devices and simultaneously, access uncontrolled networks. Split
ptunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources,
such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external
aconnections, making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational
information. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings that allow n
issuch capability in remote devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being
vconfigurable by users. Prevention can also be achieved by the detection of split tunneling (or
laof configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting
lethe connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN)
can be used to securely provision a split tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking e
connectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments, or to a specific set of pre-o
capproved addresses, without user control.

iDiscussion:  External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy server .
gis a server (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients requesting
0system resources from non-organizational or other organizational servers. System resources
0that may be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests
established through a connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and
Iprovide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices S
are one of the most common proxy servers that provide access to the Internet. Proxy servers .
can support the logging of Transmission Control Protocol sessions and the blocking of
0specific Uniform Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names. Web
5proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized
websites. Note that proxy servers may inhibit the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and 5
create the potential for “man-in-the-middle” attacks (depending on the implementation).

(a)Prevent the exfiltration of information; and
Assignment: organization-defined frequency(b)Conduct exfiltration tests [].
Discussion:  Prevention of exfiltration applies to both the intentional and unintentional
exfiltration of information. Techniques used to prevent the exfiltration of information from
Tsystems may be implemented at internal endpoints, external boundaries, and across
imanaged interfaces and include adherence to protocol formats, monitoring for beaconing s
uactivity from systems, disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly
lineeded, employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume and types of c
ttraffic expected, call backs to command and control centers, conducting penetration testing, i
monitoring for steganography, disassembling and reassembling packet headers, and using
data loss and data leakage prevention tools. Devices that enforce strict adherence to a
protocol formats include deep packet inspection firewalls and Extensible Markup Language
b(XML) gateways. The devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specifications at the
application layer and identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices that operate f
at the network or transport layers. The prevention of exfiltration is similar to data loss e
prevention or data leakage prevention and is closely associated with cross-domain solutions f
and system guards that enforce information flow requirements.

Discussion:  General source address validation techniques are applied to restrict the use of o
oillegal and unallocated source addresses as well as source addresses that should only be
/used within the system. The restriction of incoming communications traffic provides 1
.determinations that source and destination address pairs represent authorized or allowed
2communications. Determinations can be based on several factors, including the presence of
such address pairs in the lists of authorized or allowed communications, the absence of such N
address pairs in lists of unauthorized or disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules for
SStrong authentication of network authorized or allowed source and destination pairs.

systems do not enter into unsecure states where intended security properties no longer
hold. Managed interfaces include routers, firewalls, and application gateways that reside on
protected subnetworks (commonly referred to as demilitarized zones). Failures of boundary

Discussion:  Organizations can isolate system components that perform different mission or
business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information flows among system
components and provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for selected
system components. Isolating system components with boundary protection mechanisms
provides the capability for increased protection of individual system components and to
more effectively control information flows between those components. Isolating system
components provides enhanced protection that limits the potential harm from hostile cyber-
attacks and errors. The degree of isolation varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen.

system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks; cross-domain devices
