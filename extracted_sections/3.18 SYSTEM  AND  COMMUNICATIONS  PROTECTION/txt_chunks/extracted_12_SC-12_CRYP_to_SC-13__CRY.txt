0SC-12 CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Control:  Establish and manage cryptographic keys when cryptography is employed within the
Assignment: system in accordance withthe following key management requirements: [T
organization-defined requirements for key generation, distribution, storage, access, and
8destruction].
5Discussion:  Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual
5procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. Organizations define
key management requirements in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines and specify appropriate options, parameters, and
levels. Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust anchors are part of
such trust stores. This includes certificates with visibility external to organizational systems and
NIST CMVP] and [NIST CAVP] provide certificates related to the internal operations of systems. [
additional information on validated cryptographic modules and algorithms that can be used in
cryptographic key management and establishment.

Control Enhancements:
| (1) CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT  AVAILABILITY
Maintain availability of information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.
Discussion:  Escrowing of encryption keys is a common practice for ensuring availability in
the event of key loss. A forgotten passphrase is an example of losing a cryptographic key.

.Discussion:  For organizations that use external service providers (e.g., cloud service or data S
center providers), physical control of cryptographic keys provides additional assurance that .
information stored by such external providers is not subject to unauthorized disclosure or 0
