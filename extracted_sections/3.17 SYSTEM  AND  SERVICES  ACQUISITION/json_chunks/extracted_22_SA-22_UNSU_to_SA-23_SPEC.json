An example of unsupported components h\npincludes when vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can\nresult in an opportunity for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components. /\nExceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical i.\nmission or business capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the g\nsystems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option. 0\nAlternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system 2\n/components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors N\nwhen such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If\nSnecessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for\n.critical software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who 8\n0provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components through contractual\nrelationships. Such contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added 3\nvendors. The increased risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for\nexample, by prohibiting the connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks,\nor implementing other forms of isolation.\n.Related Controls:  PL-2, SA-3\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) UNSUPPORTED SYSTEM COMPONENTS  ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-22.]\nReferences:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 290\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
