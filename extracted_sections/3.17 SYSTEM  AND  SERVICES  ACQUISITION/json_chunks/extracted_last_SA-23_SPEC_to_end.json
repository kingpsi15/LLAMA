In other instances, it is done post-\ndesign, either through modifications of the system in question or by augmenting the system with\nadditional components. For example, supplemental authentication or non-repudiation functions\nmay be added to the system to enhance the identity of critical resources to other resources that\ndepend on the organization-defined resources.\nTRelated Controls:  RA-9, SA-8.\nControl Enhancements:  None. p\nliReferences:  [SP 800-160-1], [SP 800-160-2]. c\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 291"
