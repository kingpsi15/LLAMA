The risk management strategy is .\ngan important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures\n0contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy\nprograms collaborate on the development of system and services acquisition policy and 0\n8procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are\nIpreferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and\nprocedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be .\nrepresented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can\n0be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for\nsystems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can 5\nbe directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be 5\ndocumented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events\nthat may precipitate an update to system and services acquisition policy and procedures include\nassessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not\nconstitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls:  PM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100], [SP 800-160-1].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 249\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
