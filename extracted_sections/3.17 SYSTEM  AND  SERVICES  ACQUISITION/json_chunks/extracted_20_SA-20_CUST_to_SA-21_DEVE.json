  "content": "SA-20 CUSTOMIZED DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS i\nControl:  Reimplement or custom develop the following critical system components:\neAssignment: organization-defined critical system components[].\nDiscussion:  Organizations determine that certain system components likely cannot be trusted\nadue to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components for which there are no viable\nsecurity controls to adequately mitigate risk. Reimplementation or custom development of such e\nrcomponents may satisfy requirements for higher assurance and is carried out by initiating o\nchanges to system components (including hardware, software, and firmware) such that the :\ntstandard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations where no alternative\nsourcing is available and organizations choose not to reimplement or custom develop critical :\nsystem components, additional controls can be employed. Controls include enhanced auditing,\norestrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from deletion of system and\napplication files. /\nRelated Controls:  CP-2, RA-9, SA-8. 0\n/Control Enhancements:  None.
