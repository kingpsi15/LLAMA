Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the\n:quality and completeness of the content provided. System documentation may be used to\ntsupport the management of supply chain risk, incident response, and other functions. Personnel\n:or roles that require documentation include system owners, system security officers, and system\nadministrators. Attempts to obtain documentation include contacting manufacturers or suppliers o\nand conducting web-based searches. The inability to obtain documentation may occur due to the\n/age of the system or component or the lack of support from developers and contractors. When 1\n.documentation cannot be obtained, organizations may need to recreate the documentation if it 6\n2is essential to the implementation or operation of the controls. The protection provided for the\nNdocumentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system.\nDocumentation that addresses system vulnerabilities may require an increased level of T\nprotection. Secure operation of the system includes initially starting the system and resuming\n8secure system operation after a lapse in system operation.\n5Related Controls:  CM-4, CM-6, CM-7, CM-8, PL-2, PL-4, PL-8, PS-2, SA-3, SA-4, SA-8, SA-9, SA-10,\nSA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SI-12, SR-3.  5\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION  FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SECURITY CONTROLS\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4(1).]\n|- (2) SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION  SECURITYRELEVANT EXTERNAL SYSTEM INTERFACES\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4(2).]\n|- (3) SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION  HIGHLEVEL DESIGN\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4(2).]\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 256\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n|- (4) SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION  LOWLEVEL DESIGN\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4(2).]\n| (5) SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION  SOURCE CODE\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-4(2).]\nReferences:  [SP 800-160-1]."
