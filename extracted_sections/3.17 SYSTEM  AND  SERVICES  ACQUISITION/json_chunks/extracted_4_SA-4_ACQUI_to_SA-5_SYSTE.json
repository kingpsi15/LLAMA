The derived requirements include e\nsecurity and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated f\nhwith such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,\ngresistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements\nfinclude development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from\nmdevelopment and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required\nhSP 800-160-1] functionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism.

Controls are selected and implemented in 1\n.order to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities. 6\n2Controls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection\nNand implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in\nthe form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived T\nrequirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of\n8implementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\n5Security and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development\nlife cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and 5\noperation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security\ncategorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend\non the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements\ncan include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and\nservices. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in\nthe same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.\n, Related Controls:  CM-6, CM-8, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-21, SR-3\nSR-5.\nControl Enhancements:\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 252\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n|(1) ACQUISITION PROCESS  FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF CONTROLS\nRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide a\ndescription of the functional properties of the controls to be implemented.\nDiscussion:  Functional properties of security and privacy controls describe the functionality\n(i.e., security or privacy capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of the\ncontrols and specifically exclude functionality and data structures internal to the operation\nof the controls.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) ACQUISITION PROCESS  DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION FOR CONTROLS\nRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide\nSelection (one or design and implementation information for the controls that includes: [\nTmore): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level design; low-level design;\nissource code or hardware schematics; Assignment: organization-defined design and [\nuimplementation informationAssignment: organization-defined level of detail]] at [].\nDiscussion:  Organizations may require different levels of detail in the documentation for the a\nodesign and implementation of controls in organizational systems, system components, or\nisystem services based on mission and business requirements, requirements for resiliency s\nand trustworthiness, and requirements for analysis and testing. Systems can be partitioned v\niinto multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can contain one or more la\nmodules. The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of subsystems and the le\ninterfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level r\ndesign for the system is expressed in terms of modules and the interfaces between modules\nproviding security-relevant functionality. Design and implementation documentation can c\nainclude manufacturer, version, serial number, verification hash signature, software libraries\neused, date of purchase or download, and the vendor or download source. Source code and\nhardware schematics are referred to as the implementation representation of the system. o\nRelated Controls:  None.\ns|,, (3) ACQUISITION PROCESS  DEVELOPMENT METHODS TECHNIQUES AND PRACTICES\noRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service to\ndemonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes: r\nAssignment: organization-defined systems engineering methods(a)[];  0\n0Assignment: organization-definedSelection (one or more): systems security; privacy (b)[ []\nengineering methods]; and\nSAssignment: organization-defined software development methods; testing, (c)[\n.evaluation, assessment, verification, and validation methods; and quality control S\nprocesses]. .\nDiscussion:  Following a system development life cycle that includes state-of-the-practice\n3software development methods, systems engineering methods, systems security and privacy\nengineering methods, and quality control processes helps to reduce the number and severity\nof latent errors within systems, system components, and system services. Reducing the\nnumber and severity of such errors reduces the number of vulnerabilities in those systems,\ncomponents, and services. Transparency in the methods and techniques that developers\nselect and implement for systems engineering, systems security and privacy engineering,\nsoftware development, component and system assessments, and quality control processes\nprovides an increased level of assurance in the trustworthiness of the system, system\ncomponent, or system service being acquired.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (4) ACQUISITION PROCESS  ASSIGNMENT OF COMPONENTS TO SYSTEMS\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 253\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CM-8(9).]\n|,, (5) ACQUISITION PROCESS  SYSTEM COMPONENT AND SERVICE CONFIGURATIONS\nRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:\nAssignment: organization-defined (a)Deliver the system, component, or service with [\nsecurity configurations] implemented; and\n(b)Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or\nservice reinstallation or upgrade.\nDiscussion:  Examples of security configurations include the U.S. Government Configuration\nBaseline (USGCB), Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), and any limitations on\nfunctions, ports, protocols, and services.

This early involvement in the system development life cycle helps organizations\navoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily\nhigh risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols, or\nservices or requiring system service providers to do so.
