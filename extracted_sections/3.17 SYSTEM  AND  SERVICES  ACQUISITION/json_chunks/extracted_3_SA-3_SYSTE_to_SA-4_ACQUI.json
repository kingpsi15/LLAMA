The integration of r\n1security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational\nprinciple of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls 6\nwithin the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security\nNand privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical mission and business\nSA-8 help individuals properly design, code, and functions. The security engineering principles in T\ntest systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior\n8agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy\narchitects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to -\nensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational\nsystems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key\nsecurity and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to\nconduct assigned system development life cycle activities.\nThe effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise architecture also\nhelps to ensure that important security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout the\nsystem life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational mission and\nbusiness processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security and\nprivacy architectures into the enterprise architecture, consistent with the risk management\nstrategy of the organization. Because the system development life cycle involves multiple\norganizations, (e.g., external suppliers, developers, integrators, service providers), acquisition\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 250\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nand supply chain risk management functions and controls play significant roles in the effective\nmanagement of the system during the life cycle.\nSR-Related Controls:  AT-3, PL-8, PM-7, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15, SA-17, SA-22, SR-3, SR-4,\n5, SR-9.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE  MANAGE PREPRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT\nProtect system preproduction environments commensurate with risk throughout the\nsystem development life cycle for the system, system component, or system service.\nDiscussion:  The preproduction environment includes development, test, and integration\nenvironments.The program protection planning processes established by the Department of\nDefense are examples of managing the preproduction environment for defense contractors.\nhCriticality analysis and the application of controls on developers also contribute to a more\nsecure system development environment. p\nRelated Controls:  CM-2, CM-4, RA-3, RA-9, SA-4. lic\ni|o (2) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE  USE OF LIVE OR OPERATIONAL DATA\nis(a)Approve, document, and control the use of live data in preproduction environments\nvfor the system, system component, or system service; and\n(b)Protect preproduction environments for the system, system component, or system  b\nle within the service at the same impact or classification level as any live data in use\npreproduction environments.\nfDiscussion:  Live data is also referred to as operational data. The use of live or operational\ndata in preproduction (i.e., development, test, and integration) environments can result in\nsignificant risks to organizations. In addition, the use of personally identifiable information in\nftesting, research, and training increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of such r\ninformation. Therefore, it is important for the organization to manage any additional risks\nthat may result from the use of live or operational data. Organizations can minimize such t\nsrisks by using test or dummy data during the design, development, and testing of systems,\n/ dRisk assessment techniques may be used to system components, and system services.\ni.determine if the risk of using live or operational data is acceptable. o\n/Related Controls:  PM-25, RA-3. 1\n| 0(3) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE  TECHNOLOGY REFRESH\n/Plan for and implement a technology refresh schedule for the system throughout the N\nSsystem development life cycle.\nDiscussion:  Technology refresh planning may encompass hardware, software, firmware,\nprocesses, personnel skill sets, suppliers, service providers, and facilities. The use of obsolete 8\n0or nearing obsolete technology may increase the security and privacy risks associated with\n3unsupported components, counterfeit or repurposed components, components unable to\nimplement security or privacy requirements, slow or inoperable components, components\nfrom untrusted sources, inadvertent personnel error, or increased complexity. Technology\nrefreshes typically occur during the operations and maintenance stage of the system\ndevelopment life cycle.\nRelated Controls:  MA-6.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-160-1], [SP 800-171], [SP 800-172].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 251\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
