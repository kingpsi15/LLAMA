Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a v\nlvariety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, a\nllines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain e\nrexchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services e\nremains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires\ncthat organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the\nconsumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The\neextent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and\nothe external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the\n:relationships can be monitored. External system services documentation includes government,\ntservice providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. p\n:Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for implemented controls, /\nodescribe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified\ninstances of noncompliance. r\n0Related Controls:  AC-20, CA-3, CP-2, IR-4, IR-7, PL-10, PL-11, PS-7, SA-2, SA-4, SR-3, SR-5.\n2Control Enhancements:\nI| (1) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  RISK ASSESSMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALSS\nS(a)Conduct an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of\n.information security services; and 8\n(b)Verify that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is  -\nAssignment: organization-defined personnel or rolesapproved by []. r\nDiscussion:  Information security services include the operation of security devices, such as\nfirewalls or key management services as well as incident monitoring, analysis, and response.\nRisks assessed can include system, mission or business, security, privacy, or supply chain\nrisks.\nRelated Controls:  CA-6, RA-3, RA-8.\n|,,, (2) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS PORTS PROTOCOLS AND SERVICES\nRequire providers of the following external system services to identify the functions, ports,\nAssignment: protocols, and other services required for the use of such services: [\norganization-defined external system services].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 271\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDiscussion:  Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,\nports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when the\nneed arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services\nor blocking certain ports and protocols.\nRelated Controls:  CM-6, CM-7.\n| (3) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVIDERS\nEstablish, document, and maintain trust relationships with external service providers\nAssignment: based on the following requirements, properties, factors, or conditions: [\norganization-defined security and privacy requirements, properties, factors, or conditions\ndefining acceptable trust relationships].\nDiscussion:  Trust relationships between organizations and external service providers reflect\nthe degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level.\nTrust relationships can help organizations gain increased levels of confidence that service is\nproviders are providing adequate protection for the services rendered and can also be useful\nwhen conducting incident response or when planning for upgrades or obsolescence. Trust lic\nrelationships can be complicated due to the potentially large number of entities participating t\nnin the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and\ntypes of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the\nlevel of control that organizations can exert on external service providers regarding the a\ncontrols necessary for the protection of the service, information, or individual privacy and\nthe evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of the implemented controls. The level of\necontrol is established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or service-level\noagreements.\nRelated Controls:  SR-2.\ne |(4) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES CONSISTENT INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS\nmAssignment: organization-Takethe following actions to verify that the interests of [\nhdefined external service providers] are consistent with and reflect organizational interests:\nAssignment: organization-defined actions[]. s\ndDiscussion:  As organizations increasingly use external service providers, it is possible that\ni.the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational interests. In such o\nsituations, simply having the required technical, management, or operational controls in\nplace may not be sufficient if the providers that implement and manage those controls are\nnot operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming organizations.\nActions that organizations take to address such concerns include requiring background /\nSchecks for selected service provider personnel; examining ownership records; employing\n.only trustworthy service providers, such as providers with which organizations have had S\nsuccessful trust relationships; and conducting routine, periodic, unscheduled visits to service .\nprovider facilities. 0\n3Related Controls:  None.\n|,, (5) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  PROCESSING STORAGE AND SERVICE LOCATION\nSelection (one or more): information processing; information or Restrict the location of [\ndata; system servicesAssignment: organization-defined locations] to [] based on\nAssignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions[].\nDiscussion:  The location of information processing, information and data storage, or system\nservices can have a direct impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their\nmission and business functions. The impact occurs when external providers control the\nlocation of processing, storage, or services. The criteria that external providers use for the\nselection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from the criteria that\norganizations use. For example, organizations may desire that data or information storage\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 272\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nlocations be restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident response activities in\ncase of information security incidents or breaches. Incident response activities, including\nforensic analyses and after-the-fact investigations, may be adversely affected by the\ngoverning laws, policies, or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur\nand/or the locations from which system services emanate.\n. Related Controls:  SA-5, SR-4\n|- (6) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  ORGANIZATIONCONTROLLED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS\nMaintain exclusive control of cryptographic keys for encrypted material stored or\ntransmitted through an external system.\nDiscussion:  Maintaining exclusive control of cryptographic keys in an external system\nprevents decryption of organizational data by external system staff. Organizational control\nof cryptographic keys can be implemented by encrypting and decrypting data inside the\norganization as data is sent to and received from the external system or by employing a is\ncomponent that permits encryption and decryption functions to be local to the external\nsystem but allows exclusive organizational access to the encryption keys.  lic\ntRelated Controls:  SC-12, SC-13, SI-4. i\nis|- (7) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  ORGANIZATIONCONTROLLED INTEGRITY CHECKING\naProvide the capability to check the integrity of information while it resides in the external\nsystem. b\nDiscussion:  Storage of organizational information in an external system could limit visibility f\neinto the security status of its data. The ability of the organization to verify and validate the\nfintegrity of its stored data without transferring it out of the external system provides such\nvisibility.  a\neRelated Controls:  SI-7.\nm|\u2014.. (8) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  PROCESSING AND STORAGE LOCATION  US JURISDICTION\nRestrict the geographic location of information processing and data storage to facilities t\nlocated within in the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United States.\nDiscussion:  The geographic location of information processing and data storage can have a o\ndirect impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their mission and\n/business functions. A compromise or breach of high impact information and systems can 1\n.have severe or catastrophic adverse impacts on organizational assets and operations, 6\n2individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Restricting the processing and storage of\nNhigh-impact information to facilities within the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United\nStates provides greater control over such processing and storage.
