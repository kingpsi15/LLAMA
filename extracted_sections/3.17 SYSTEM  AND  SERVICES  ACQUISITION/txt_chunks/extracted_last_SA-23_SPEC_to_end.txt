Discussion:  It is often necessary for a system or system component that supports mission-
essential services or functions to be enhanced to maximize the trustworthiness of the resource.
Sometimes this enhancement is done at the design level. In other instances, it is done post-
design, either through modifications of the system in question or by augmenting the system with
additional components. For example, supplemental authentication or non-repudiation functions
may be added to the system to enhance the identity of critical resources to other resources that
depend on the organization-defined resources.
