SA-9 EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES
Control:
a.Require that providers of external system services comply with organizational security and
Assignment: organization-defined privacy requirements and employ the following controls: [
controls];
b.Define and document organizational oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard
to external system services; and
i the following processes, methods, and techniques to monitor control compliance by c.Employ s
Assignment: organization-defined processes, external service providers on an ongoing basis: [u
lmethods, and techniques]. ic
Discussion:  External system services are provided by an external provider, and the organization
ihas no direct control over the implementation of the required controls or the assessment of s
control effectiveness. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a v
lvariety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, a
llines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain e
rexchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services e
remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires
cthat organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the
consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The
eextent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and
othe external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the
:relationships can be monitored. External system services documentation includes government,
tservice providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. p
:Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for implemented controls, /
odescribe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified
instances of noncompliance. r

Discussion:  Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,
ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when the
need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services
or blocking certain ports and protocols.
Related Controls:  CM-6, CM-7.
| (3) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVIDERS
Establish, document, and maintain trust relationships with external service providers
Assignment: based on the following requirements, properties, factors, or conditions: [
organization-defined security and privacy requirements, properties, factors, or conditions
defining acceptable trust relationships].
Discussion:  Trust relationships between organizations and external service providers reflect
the degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level.
Trust relationships can help organizations gain increased levels of confidence that service is
providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered and can also be useful
when conducting incident response or when planning for upgrades or obsolescence. Trust lic
relationships can be complicated due to the potentially large number of entities participating t
nin the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and
types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the
level of control that organizations can exert on external service providers regarding the a
controls necessary for the protection of the service, information, or individual privacy and
the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of the implemented controls. The level of
econtrol is established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or service-level
oagreements.
Related Controls:  SR-2.
e |(4) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES CONSISTENT INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS
mAssignment: organization-Takethe following actions to verify that the interests of [
hdefined external service providers] are consistent with and reflect organizational interests:
Assignment: organization-defined actions[]. s
dDiscussion:  As organizations increasingly use external service providers, it is possible that
i.the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational interests. In such o
situations, simply having the required technical, management, or operational controls in
place may not be sufficient if the providers that implement and manage those controls are
not operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming organizations.
Actions that organizations take to address such concerns include requiring background /
Schecks for selected service provider personnel; examining ownership records; employing
.only trustworthy service providers, such as providers with which organizations have had S
successful trust relationships; and conducting routine, periodic, unscheduled visits to service .
provider facilities. 0

Selection (one or more): information processing; information or Restrict the location of [
data; system servicesAssignment: organization-defined locations] to [] based on
Assignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions[].
Discussion:  The location of information processing, information and data storage, or system
services can have a direct impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their
mission and business functions. The impact occurs when external providers control the
location of processing, storage, or services. The criteria that external providers use for the
selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from the criteria that
organizations use. For example, organizations may desire that data or information storage

locations be restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident response activities in
case of information security incidents or breaches. Incident response activities, including
forensic analyses and after-the-fact investigations, may be adversely affected by the
governing laws, policies, or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur
and/or the locations from which system services emanate.

|- (6) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  ORGANIZATIONCONTROLLED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS
Maintain exclusive control of cryptographic keys for encrypted material stored or
transmitted through an external system.
Discussion:  Maintaining exclusive control of cryptographic keys in an external system
prevents decryption of organizational data by external system staff. Organizational control
of cryptographic keys can be implemented by encrypting and decrypting data inside the
organization as data is sent to and received from the external system or by employing a is
component that permits encryption and decryption functions to be local to the external
system but allows exclusive organizational access to the encryption keys.  lic

aProvide the capability to check the integrity of information while it resides in the external
system. b
Discussion:  Storage of organizational information in an external system could limit visibility f
einto the security status of its data. The ability of the organization to verify and validate the
fintegrity of its stored data without transferring it out of the external system provides such
visibility.  a
eRelated Controls:  SI-7.
m|â€”.. (8) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES  PROCESSING AND STORAGE LOCATION  US JURISDICTION
Restrict the geographic location of information processing and data storage to facilities t
located within in the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United States.
Discussion:  The geographic location of information processing and data storage can have a o
direct impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their mission and
/business functions. A compromise or breach of high impact information and systems can 1
.have severe or catastrophic adverse impacts on organizational assets and operations, 6
2individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Restricting the processing and storage of
Nhigh-impact information to facilities within the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United
States provides greater control over such processing and storage. T
