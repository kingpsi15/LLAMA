SA-4 ACQUISITION PROCESS
Control:  Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference,
Selection (one or more): standardized contract language;Assignment: organization-using [ [
defined contract language]] in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or
system service:
a.Security and privacy functional requirements;
b.Strength of mechanism requirements;
c.Security and privacy assurance requirements;
d.Controls needed to satisfy the security and privacy requirements.
e.Security and privacy documentation requirements;
if.Requirements for protecting security and privacy documentation;  s
bg.Description of the system development environment and environment in which the system
is intended to operate; a
h.Allocation of responsibility or identification of parties responsible for information security,
privacy, and supply chain risk management; and a
li.Acceptance criteria.  a
Discussion:  Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-
level security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements include e
security and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated f
hwith such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,
gresistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements
finclude development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from
mdevelopment and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required
hSP 800-160-1] functionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [
describes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle. s
Controls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate o
for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting
/the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in 1
.order to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities. 6
2Controls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection
Nand implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in
the form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived T
requirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of
8implementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.
5Security and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development
life cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and 5
operation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security
categorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend
on the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements
can include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and
services. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in
the same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.

|(1) ACQUISITION PROCESS  FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF CONTROLS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide a
description of the functional properties of the controls to be implemented.
Discussion:  Functional properties of security and privacy controls describe the functionality
(i.e., security or privacy capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of the
controls and specifically exclude functionality and data structures internal to the operation
of the controls.
Related Controls:  None.
| (2) ACQUISITION PROCESS  DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION FOR CONTROLS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide
Selection (one or design and implementation information for the controls that includes: [
Tmore): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level design; low-level design;
issource code or hardware schematics; Assignment: organization-defined design and [
uimplementation informationAssignment: organization-defined level of detail]] at [].
Discussion:  Organizations may require different levels of detail in the documentation for the a
odesign and implementation of controls in organizational systems, system components, or
isystem services based on mission and business requirements, requirements for resiliency s
and trustworthiness, and requirements for analysis and testing. Systems can be partitioned v
iinto multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can contain one or more la
modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of subsystems and the le
interfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level r
design for the system is expressed in terms of modules and the interfaces between modules
providing security-relevant functionality. Design and implementation documentation can c
ainclude manufacturer, version, serial number, verification hash signature, software libraries
eused, date of purchase or download, and the vendor or download source. Source code and
hardware schematics are referred to as the implementation representation of the system. o
Related Controls:  None.
s|,, (3) ACQUISITION PROCESS  DEVELOPMENT METHODS TECHNIQUES AND PRACTICES
oRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service to
demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes: r

engineering methods]; and
SAssignment: organization-defined software development methods; testing, (c)[
.evaluation, assessment, verification, and validation methods; and quality control S
processes]. .
Discussion:  Following a system development life cycle that includes state-of-the-practice
3software development methods, systems engineering methods, systems security and privacy
engineering methods, and quality control processes helps to reduce the number and severity
of latent errors within systems, system components, and system services. Reducing the
number and severity of such errors reduces the number of vulnerabilities in those systems,
components, and services. Transparency in the methods and techniques that developers
select and implement for systems engineering, systems security and privacy engineering,
software development, component and system assessments, and quality control processes
provides an increased level of assurance in the trustworthiness of the system, system
component, or system service being acquired.

security configurations] implemented; and

Discussion:  Examples of security configurations include the U.S. Government Configuration
Baseline (USGCB), Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), and any limitations on
functions, ports, protocols, and services. Security characteristics can include requiring that
default passwords have been changed.

| 5(8) ACQUISITION PROCESS  CONTINUOUS MONITORING PLAN FOR CONTROLS
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to produce a
plan for continuous monitoring of control effectiveness that is consistent with the
continuous monitoring program of the organization.
Discussion:  The objective of continuous monitoring plans is to determine if the planned,
required, and deployed controls within the system, system component, or system service
continue to be effective over time based on the inevitable changes that occur. Developer
continuous monitoring plans include a sufficient level of detail such that the information can
be incorporated into continuous monitoring programs implemented by organizations.
Continuous monitoring plans can include the types of control assessment and monitoring

|,,, (9) ACQUISITION PROCESS  FUNCTIONS PORTS PROTOCOLS AND SERVICES IN USE
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to identify the
functions, ports, protocols, and services intended for organizational use.
Discussion:  The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in the system
development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design stages)
allows organizations to influence the design of the system, system component, or system
service. This early involvement in the system development life cycle helps organizations
avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily
high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols, or
services or requiring system service providers to do so. Early identification of functions, is
