SA-5 SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION
Control:
a.Obtain or develop administrator documentation for the system, system component, or
system service that describes:
1.Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component, or service;
2.Effective use and maintenance of security and privacy functions and mechanisms; and
3.Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative or privileged
functions;
b.Obtain or develop user documentation for the system, system component, or system service
that describes:
i1.User-accessible security and privacy functions and mechanisms and how to effectively  s
use those functions and mechanisms; u
2.Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component,  a
or service in a more secure manner and protect individual privacy; and
3.User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service  a
aand privacy of individuals;
lc.Document attempts to obtain system, system component, or system service documentation  e
rAssignment: when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and take [
organization-defined actions ] in response; and
hAssignment: organization-defined personnel or rolesd.Distribute documentation to [].
eDiscussion:  System documentation helps personnel understand the implementation and
ooperation of controls. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the
:quality and completeness of the content provided. System documentation may be used to
tsupport the management of supply chain risk, incident response, and other functions. Personnel
:or roles that require documentation include system owners, system security officers, and system
administrators. Attempts to obtain documentation include contacting manufacturers or suppliers o
and conducting web-based searches. The inability to obtain documentation may occur due to the
/age of the system or component or the lack of support from developers and contractors. When 1
.documentation cannot be obtained, organizations may need to recreate the documentation if it 6
2is essential to the implementation or operation of the controls. The protection provided for the
Ndocumentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system.
Documentation that addresses system vulnerabilities may require an increased level of T
protection. Secure operation of the system includes initially starting the system and resuming
8secure system operation after a lapse in system operation.
