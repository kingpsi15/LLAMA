SA-20 CUSTOMIZED DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS i
Control:  Reimplement or custom develop the following critical system components:
eAssignment: organization-defined critical system components[].
Discussion:  Organizations determine that certain system components likely cannot be trusted
adue to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components for which there are no viable
security controls to adequately mitigate risk. Reimplementation or custom development of such e
rcomponents may satisfy requirements for higher assurance and is carried out by initiating o
changes to system components (including hardware, software, and firmware) such that the :
tstandard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations where no alternative
sourcing is available and organizations choose not to reimplement or custom develop critical :
system components, additional controls can be employed. Controls include enhanced auditing,
orestrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from deletion of system and
application files. /
