Assignment: organization-defined personnelfindings to [].
Discussion:  Organizations consider the quality and completeness of configuration management
activities conducted by developers as direct evidence of applying effective security controls.
Controls include protecting the master copies of material used to generate security-relevant
portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware from unauthorized modification or
destruction. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the system, system component, or system
service requires strict configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to
track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.
The configuration items that are placed under configuration managementinclude the formal  T
imodel; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; s
implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the current running u
lversion of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware ic
descriptions and source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. t
Depending on the mission and business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual
relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support during the a
aoperations and maintenance stage of the system development life cycle.

integrity verification of software and firmware components. m
hDiscussion:  Software and firmware integrity verification allows organizations to detect
unauthorized changes to software and firmware components using developer-provided s
/tools, techniques, and mechanisms. The integrity checking mechanisms can also address d
icounterfeiting of software and firmware components. Organizations verify the integrity of .
gsoftware and firmware components, for example, through secure one-way hashes provided

Discussion:  Alternate configuration management processes may be required when
organizations use commercial off-the-shelf information technology products. Alternate
configuration management processes include organizational personnel who review and
approve proposed changes to systems, system components, and system services and
conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to
systems, components, or services.

Discussion:  Hardware integrity verification allows organizations to detect unauthorized
changes to hardware components using developer-provided tools, techniques, methods, and
mechanisms. Organizations may verify the integrity of hardware components with hard-to-
copy labels, verifiable serial numbers provided by developers, and by requiring the use of
anti-tamper technologies. Delivered hardware components also include hardware and
firmware updates to such components.
Related Controls:  SI-7.
| (4) DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT  TRUSTED GENERATION
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ
tools for comparing newly generated versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions,
source code, and object code with previous versions.
Discussion:  The trusted generation of descriptions, source code, and object code addresses
authorized changes to hardware, software, and firmware components between versions is
during development. The focus is on the efficacy of the configuration management process
by the developer to ensure that newly generated versions of security-relevant hardware lic
descriptions, source code, and object code continue to enforce the security policy for the t
nSA-10(1) and SA-10(3) allow system, system component, or system service. In contrast,

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to maintain
hthe integrity of the mapping between the master build data describing the current version
of security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware and the on-site master copy of the g
data for the current version. f
Discussion:  Mapping integrity for version control addresses changes to hardware, software,
and firmware components during both initial development and system development life t
scycle updates. Maintaining the integrity between the master copies of security-relevant
dhardware, software, and firmware (including designs, hardware drawings, source code) and
i.the equivalent data in master copies in operational environments is essential to ensuring the o
availability of organizational systems that support critical mission and business functions.

expertise is important because changes to system configurations can have unintended side
effects, some of which may be security- or privacy-relevant. Detecting such changes early in
