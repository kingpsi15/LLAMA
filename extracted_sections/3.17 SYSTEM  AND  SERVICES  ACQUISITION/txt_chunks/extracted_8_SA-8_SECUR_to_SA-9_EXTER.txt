Discussion:  Systems security and privacy engineering principles are closely related to and le
fimplemented throughout the system development life cycle (see SA-3). Organizations can apply r
systems security and privacy engineering principles to new systems under development or to
systems undergoing upgrades. For existing systems, organizations apply systems security and c
aprivacy engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given
ethe current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems.
mThe application of systems security and privacy engineering principles helps organizations
hdevelop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduces the susceptibility to disruptions,
hazards, threats, and the creation of privacy problems for individuals. Examples of system
security engineering principles include: developing layered protections; establishing security and /
privacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development; i.
incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle; g
delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how 0
to build secure software; tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; and performing threat 0
8modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and
compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. I
SOrganizations that apply systems security and privacy engineering concepts and principles can
.facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system 8
0services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions. System
3security engineering principles can also be used to protect against certain supply chain risks,
including incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into a design.

Implement the security design principle of clear abstractions.
Discussion:  The principle of clear abstractions states that a system has simple, well-defined
interfaces and functions that provide a consistent and intuitive view of the data and how the
data is managed. The clarity, simplicity, necessity, and sufficiency of the system interfaces—

combined with a precise definition of their functional behavior—promotes ease of analysis,
inspection, and testing as well as the correct and secure use of the system. The clarity of an
abstraction is subjective. Examples that reflect the application of this principle include
avoidance of redundant, unused interfaces; information hiding; and avoidance of semantic
overloading of interfaces or their parameters. Information hiding (i.e., representation-
independent programming), is a design discipline used to ensure that the internal
representation of information in one system component is not visible to another system
component, such that the published abstraction is component invoking or calling the first

Assignment: Implement the security design principle of least common mechanism in [
horganization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of least common mechanism states that the amount of mechanism
common to more than one user and depended on by all users is minimized [POPEK74]. lic
Mechanism minimization implies that different components of a system refrain from using t
nthe same mechanism to access a system resource. Every shared mechanism (especially a
mechanism involving shared variables) represents a potential information path between
users and is designed with care to ensure that it does not unintentionally compromise a

: | (3) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  MODULARITY AND LAYERING
Assignment: Implement the security design principles of modularity and layering in [
/organization-defined systems or system components]. d
i.Discussion:  The principles of modularity and layering are fundamental across system o
engineering disciplines. Modularity and layering derived from functional decomposition are
effective in managing system complexity by making it possible to comprehend the structure
of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement in system design, is challenging and
resists general statements of principle. Modularity serves to isolate functions and related /
Sdata structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these
.units to be better understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can S
be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity to .
include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and security policy. 0
Security-informed modular decomposition includes the allocation of policies to systems in a
5network, separation of system applications into processes with distinct address spaces,
allocation of system policies to layers, and separation of processes into subjects with distinct
privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains.

in system design is layering, whereby the system is organized into well-defined, functionally

related modules or components. The layers are linearly ordered with respect to inter-layer
dependencies, such that higher layers are dependent on lower layers. While providing
functionality to higher layers, some layers can be self-contained and not dependent on lower
layers. While a partial ordering of all functions in a given system may not be possible, if
circular dependencies are constrained to occur within layers, the inherent problems of
circularity can be more easily managed. Partially ordered dependencies and system layering
contribute significantly to the simplicity and coherency of the system design. Partially
ordered dependencies also facilitate system testing and analysis.

|(5) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  EFFICIENTLY MEDIATED ACCESS
Assignment: Implement the security design principle of efficiently mediated access in [
organization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of efficiently mediated access states that policy enforcement is
mechanisms utilize the least common mechanism available while satisfying stakeholder
expressed constraints. The mediation of access to system resources requirements withinlic
(i.e., CPU, memory, devices, communication ports, services, infrastructure, data, and t
ninformation) is often the predominant security function of secure systems. It also enables
the realization of protections for the capability provided to stakeholders by the system.
Mediation of resource access can result in performance bottlenecks if the system is not a
designed correctly. For example, by using hardware mechanisms, efficiently mediated access
can be achieved. Once access to a low-level resource such as memory has been obtained,
ehardware protection mechanisms can ensure that out-of-bounds access does not occur.

|(6) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  MINIMIZED SHARING r
Assignment: Implement the security design principle of minimized sharing in [f
morganization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of minimized sharing states that no computer resource is shared t
sbetween system components (e.g., subjects, processes, functions) unless it is absolutely
dnecessary to do so. Minimized sharing helps to simplify system design and implementation.
i.In order to protect user-domain resources from arbitrary active entities, no resource is o
shared unless that sharing has been explicitly requested and granted. The need for resource
sharing can be motivated by the design principle of least common mechanism in the case of
internal entities or driven by stakeholder requirements. However, internal sharing is
carefully designed to avoid performance and covert storage and timing channel problems. /
SSharing via common mechanism can increase the susceptibility of data and information to
.unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or modification and can adversely affect the inherent S
capability provided by the system. To minimize sharing induced by common mechanisms, .
such mechanisms can be designed to be reentrant or virtualized to preserve separation. 0
Moreover, the use of global data to share information is carefully scrutinized. The lack of
5encapsulation may obfuscate relationships among the sharing entities.

|(7) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  REDUCED COMPLEXITY
Assignment: Implement the security design principle of reduced complexity in [
organization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of reduced complexity states that the system design is as simple
and small as possible. A small and simple design is more understandable, more analyzable,
and less prone to error. The reduced complexity principle applies to any aspect of a system,
but it has particular importance for security due to the various analyses performed to obtain
evidence about the emergent security property of the system. For such analyses to be

successful, a small and simple design is essential. Application of the principle of reduced
complexity contributes to the ability of system developers to understand the correctness
and completeness of system security functions. It also facilitates the identification of
potential vulnerabilities. The corollary of reduced complexity states that the simplicity of the
system is directly related to the number of vulnerabilities it will contain; that is, simpler
systems contain fewer vulnerabilities. An benefit of reduced complexity is that it is easier to
understand whether the intended security policy has been captured in the system design
and that fewer vulnerabilities are likely to be introduced during engineering development.
An additional benefit is that any such conclusion about correctness, completeness, and the
existence of vulnerabilities can be reached with a higher degree of assurance in contrast to
conclusions reached in situations where the system design is inherently more complex.
Transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to
IPv6) may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the
transition period. This may result in a temporary increase in system complexity during the h
transition. p

i |(8)o SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  SECURE EVOLVABILITY
isAssignment: Implement the security design principle of secure evolvability in [
vorganization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of secure evolvability states that a system is developed to facilitate
the maintenance of its security properties when there are changes to the system’s structure,
einterfaces, interconnections (i.e., system architecture), functionality, or configuration (i.e.,
osecurity policy enforcement). Changes include a new, enhanced, or upgraded system
capability; maintenance and sustainment activities; and reconfiguration. Although it is not h
rpossible to plan for every aspect of system evolution, system upgrades and changes can be g
changes in the anticipated by analyses of mission or business strategic direction, anticipatedf
threat environment, and anticipated maintenance and sustainment needs. It is unrealistic to m
expect that complex systems remain secure in contexts not envisioned during development, h
pwhether such contexts are related to the operational environment or to usage. A system
/may be secure in some new contexts, but there is no guarantee that its emergent behavior /
will always be secure. It is easier to build trustworthiness into a system from the outset, and i.
rit follows that the sustainment of system trustworthiness requires planning for change as g
opposed to adapting in an ad hoc or non-methodical manner. The benefits of this principle 0
include reduced vendor life cycle costs, reduced cost of ownership, improved system 0
8security, more effective management of security risk, and less risk uncertainty.

|(9) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  TRUSTED COMPONENTS P
0Assignment: Implement the security design principle of trusted components in [
organization-defined systems or system components]. 5
5Discussion:  The principle of trusted components states that a component is trustworthy to
at least a level commensurate with the security dependencies it supports (i.e., how much it
is trusted to perform its security functions by other components). This principle enables the
composition of components such that trustworthiness is not inadvertently diminished and
the trust is not consequently misplaced. Ultimately, this principle demands some metric by
which the trust in a component and the trustworthiness of a component can be measured
on the same abstract scale. The principle of trusted components is particularly relevant
when considering systems and components in which there are complex chains of trust
dependencies. A trust dependency is also referred to as a trust relationship and there may
be chains of trust relationships.

The principle of trusted components also applies to a compound component that consists of
subcomponents (e.g., a subsystem), which may have varying levels of trustworthiness. The
conservative assumption is that the trustworthiness of a compound component is that of its
least trustworthy subcomponent. It may be possible to provide a security engineering
rationale that the trustworthiness of a particular compound component is greater than the
conservative assumption. However, any such rationale reflects logical reasoning based on a
clear statement of the trustworthiness objectives as well as relevant and credible evidence.
The trustworthiness of a compound component is not the same as increased application of
defense-in-depth layering within the component or a replication of components. Defense-in-
depth techniques do not increase the trustworthiness of the whole above that of the least
trustworthy component.

T |(10) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  HIERARCHICAL TRUST h
Assignment: organization-Implement the security design principle of hierarchical trust in [p
bdefined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of hierarchical trust for components builds on the principle of t
ntrusted components and states that the security dependencies in a system will form a partial
ordering if they preserve the principle of trusted components. The partial ordering provides
the basis for trustworthiness reasoning or an assurance case (assurance argument) when a
composing a secure system from heterogeneously trustworthy components. To analyze a
system composed of heterogeneously trustworthy components for its trustworthiness, it is
eessential to eliminate circular dependencies with regard to the trustworthiness. If a more
otrustworthy component located in a lower layer of the system were to depend on a less
trustworthy component in a higher layer, this would, in effect, put the components in the h
rsame “less trustworthy” equivalence class per the principle of trusted components. Trust g
relationships, or chains of trust, can have various manifestations. For example, the root f
certificate of a certificate hierarchy is the most trusted node in the hierarchy, whereas the m
leaves in the hierarchy may be the least trustworthy nodes. Another example occurs in a h
playered high-assurance system where the security kernel (including the hardware base),
/which is located at the lowest layer of the system, is the most trustworthy component. The /
principle of hierarchical trust, however, does not prohibit the use of overly trustworthy i.
rcomponents. There may be cases in a system of low trustworthiness where it is reasonable g
to employ a highly trustworthy component rather than one that is less trustworthy (e.g., due 0
6 highly to availability or other cost-benefit driver). For such a case, any dependency of the0
8trustworthy component upon a less trustworthy component does not degrade the
trustworthiness of the resulting low-trust system. I

Assignment: Implement the security design principle of inverse modification threshold in [5
rorganization-defined systems or system components]. 5
Discussion:  The principle of inverse modification threshold builds on the principle of trusted
components and the principle of hierarchical trust and states that the degree of protection
provided to a component is commensurate with its trustworthiness. As the trust placed in a
component increases, the protection against unauthorized modification of the component
also increases to the same degree. Protection from unauthorized modification can come in
the form of the component’s own self-protection and innate trustworthiness, or it can come
from the protections afforded to the component from other elements or attributes of the
security architecture (to include protections in the environment of operation).

|(12) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  HIERARCHICAL PROTECTION
Assignment: Implement the security design principle of hierarchical protection in [
organization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of hierarchical protection states that a component need not be
protected from more trustworthy components. In the degenerate case of the most trusted
component, it protects itself from all other components. For example, if an operating system
kernel is deemed the most trustworthy component in a system, then it protects itself from
all untrusted applications it supports, but the applications, conversely, do not need to
protect themselves from the kernel. The trustworthiness of users is a consideration for
applying the principle of hierarchical protection. A trusted system need not protect itself
from an equally trustworthy user, reflecting use of untrusted systems in “system high”
environments where users are highly trustworthy and where other protections are put in
Tplace to bound and protect the “system high” execution environment.

Assignment: iImplement the security design principle of minimized security elements in [o
organization-defined systems or system components ].
Discussion:  The principle of minimized security elements states that the system does not v
ihave extraneous trusted components. The principle of minimized security elements has two la
aspects: the overall cost of security analysis and the complexity of security analysis. Trusted le
components are generally costlier to construct and implement, owing to the increased rigor r
of development processes. Trusted components require greater security analysis to qualify
their trustworthiness. Thus, to reduce the cost and decrease the complexity of the security c
aanalysis, a system contains as few trustworthy components as possible. The analysis of the
einteraction of trusted components with other components of the system is one of the most
important aspects of system security verification. If the interactions between components o
are unnecessarily complex, the security of the system will also be more difficult to ascertain :
tthan one whose internal trust relationships are simple and elegantly constructed. In general, t
fewer trusted components result in fewer internal trust relationships and a simpler system. :

|(14) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  LEAST PRIVILEGE /
.Assignment: organization-Implement the security design principle of least privilege in [6
2defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of least privilege states that each system component is allocated
Tsufficient privileges to accomplish its specified functions but no more. Applying the principle
of least privilege limits the scope of the component’s actions, which has two desirable P
effects: the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the component will have a 0
-minimized security impact, and the security analysis of the component will be simplified.
Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system r
design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets
of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity of
privilege decomposition. For example, in the case of an audit mechanism, there may be an
interface for the audit manager, who configures the audit settings; an interface for the audit
finally, yet another operator, who ensures that audit data is safely collected and stored; and,
interface for the audit reviewer, who only has need to view the audit data that has been
collected but no need to perform operations on that data.
In addition to its manifestations at the system interface, least privilege can be used as a
guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself. One aspect of internal least
privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the module are

directly operated on by the functions within the module. Elements external to a module that
may be affected by the module’s operation are indirectly accessed through interaction (e.g.,
via a function call) with the module that contains those elements. Another aspect of internal
least privilege is that the scope of a given module or component includes only those system
elements that are necessary for its functionality and that the access modes for the elements
(e.g., read, write) are minimal.

|(15) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  PREDICATE PERMISSION
Assignment: Implement the security design principle of predicate permission in [
organization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of predicate permission states that system designers consider
requiring multiple authorized entities to provide consent before a highly critical operation or
SALTZER75] access to highly sensitive data, information, or resources is allowed to proceed. [is
originally named predicate permission the separation of privilege. It is also equivalent to
separation of duty. The division of privilege among multiple parties decreases the likelihood lic
of abuse and provides the safeguard that no single accident, deception, or breach of trust is t
nsufficient to enable an unrecoverable action that can lead to significantly damaging effects.
The design options for such a mechanism may require simultaneous action (e.g., the firing of
a nuclear weapon requires two different authorized individuals to give the correct command a
within a small time window) or a sequence of operations where each successive action is
enabled by some prior action, but no single individual is able to enable more than one

Assignment: Implement the security design principle of self-reliant trustworthiness in [f

sreliance on other systems for their own trustworthiness. A system is trustworthy by default,
dand any connection to an external entity is used to supplement its function. If a system were
i.required to maintain a connection with another external entity in order to maintain its o
trustworthiness, then that system would be vulnerable to malicious and non-malicious
threats that could result in the loss or degradation of that connection. The benefit of the
principle of self-reliant trustworthiness is that the isolation of a system will make it less
vulnerable to attack. A corollary to this principle relates to the ability of the system (or /

enforces that policy at least as well as the individual components do. Many of the design
principles for secure systems deal with how components can or should interact. The need to
create or enable a capability from the composition of distributed components can magnify
the relevancy of these principles. In particular, the translation of security policy from a
stand-alone to a distributed system or a system-of-systems can have unexpected or
emergent results. Communication protocols and distributed data consistency mechanisms
help to ensure consistent policy enforcement across a distributed system. To ensure a

interconnections between components), each communication channel is trustworthy to a
level commensurate with the security dependencies it supports (i.e., how much it is trusted
by other components to perform its security functions). Trusted communication channels
are achieved by a combination of restricting access to the communication channel (to ensure
an acceptable match in the trustworthiness of the endpoints involved in the communication) is
and employing end-to-end protections for the data transmitted over the communication

v|(19) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  CONTINUOUS PROTECTION
Assignment: Implement the security design principle of continuous protection in [b
organization-defined systems or system components].
eDiscussion:  The principle of continuous protection states that components and data used to
fenforce the security policy have uninterrupted protection that is consistent with the security
policy and the security architecture assumptions. No assurances that the system can provide a
the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy protections for its design capability can
be made if there are gaps in the protection. Any assurances about the ability to secure a r
delivered capability require that data and information are continuously protected. That is,
there are no periods during which data and information are left unprotected while under t
scontrol of the system (i.e., during the creation, storage, processing, or communication of the
ddata and information, as well as during system initialization, execution, failure, interruption,
i.and shutdown). Continuous protection requires adherence to the precepts of the reference o
monitor concept (i.e., every request is validated by the reference monitor; the reference
monitor is able to protect itself from tampering; and sufficient assurance of the correctness
and completeness of the mechanism can be ascertained from analysis and testing) and the
principle of secure failure and recovery (i.e., preservation of a secure state during error, /
Sfault, failure, and successful attack; preservation of a secure state during recovery to normal,
.degraded, or alternative operational modes). S
8Continuous protection also applies to systems designed to operate in varying configurations,
including those that deliver full operational capability and degraded-mode configurations -
that deliver partial operational capability. The continuous protection principle requires that r
changes to the system security policies be traceable to the operational need that drives the
configuration and be verifiable (i.e., it is possible to verify that the proposed changes will not
put the system into an insecure state). Insufficient traceability and verification may lead to
inconsistent states or protection discontinuities due to the complex or undecidable nature of
the problem. The use of pre-verified configuration definitions that reflect the new security
policy enables analysis to determine that a transition from old to new policies is essentially
atomic and that any residual effects from the old policy are guaranteed to not conflict with
the new policy. The ability to demonstrate continuous protection is rooted in the clear
articulation of life cycle protection needs as stakeholder security requirements.

|(20) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  SECURE METADATA MANAGEMENT
Assignment: Implement the security design principle of secure metadata management in [
organization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of secure metadata management states that metadata are “first
class” objects with respect to security policy when the policy requires either complete
protection of information or that the security subsystem be self-protecting. The principle of
secure metadata management is driven by the recognition that a system, subsystem, or
component cannot achieve self-protection unless it protects the data it relies on for correct
execution. Data is generally not interpreted by the system that stores it. It may have
semantic value (i.e., it comprises information) to users and programs that process the data.
In contrast, metadata is information about data, such as a file name or the date when the
file was created. Metadata is bound to the target data that it describes in a way that the
Tsystem can interpret, but it need not be stored inside of or proximate to its target data.
isThere may be metadata whose target is itself metadata (e.g., the classification level or
uimpact level of a file name), including self-referential metadata.
aThe apparent secondary nature of metadata can lead to neglect of its legitimate need for
protection, resulting in a violation of the security policy that includes the exfiltration of
isinformation. A particular concern associated with insufficient protections for metadata is
vassociated with multilevel secure (MLS) systems. MLS systems mediate access by a subject to
lan object based on relative sensitivity levels. It follows that all subjects and objects in the a
lscope of control of the MLS system are either directly labeled or indirectly attributed with e
rsensitivity levels. The corollary of labeled metadata for MLS systems states that objects e
containing metadata are labeled. As with protection needs assessments for data, attention is o
cgiven to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity protections are individually assessed,
specified, and allocated to metadata, as would be done for mission, business, and system r
data.

t |-(21) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  SELFANALYSIS t
Assignment: organization-/Implement the security design principle of self-analysis in [
odefined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of self-analysis states that a system component is able to assess its g
internal state and functionality to a limited extent at various stages of execution, and that 0
this self-analysis capability is commensurate with the level of trustworthiness invested in the 0
8system. At the system level, self-analysis can be achieved through hierarchical assessments
of trustworthiness established in a bottom-up fashion. In this approach, the lower-level I
components check for data integrity and correct functionality (to a limited extent) of higher-
Plevel components. For example, trusted boot sequences involve a trusted lower-level
0component that attests to the trustworthiness of the next higher-level components so that a
transitive chain of trust can be established. At the root, a component attests to itself, which 5
rusually involves an axiomatic or environmentally enforced assumption about its integrity. 5
Results of the self-analyses can be used to guard against externally induced errors, internal
malfunction, or transient errors. By following this principle, some simple malfunctions or
errors can be detected without allowing the effects of the error or malfunction to propagate
outside of the component. Further, the self-test can be used to attest to the configuration of
the component, detecting any potential conflicts in configuration with respect to the
expected configuration.

Assignment: Implement the security design principle of accountability and traceability in [
organization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of accountability and traceability states that it is possible to trace
security-relevant actions (i.e., subject-object interactions) to the entity on whose behalf the
action is being taken. The principle of accountability and traceability requires a trustworthy
infrastructure that can record details about actions that affect system security (e.g., an audit
subsystem). To record the details about actions, the system is able to uniquely identify the
entity on whose behalf the action is being carried out and also record the relevant sequence
of actions that are carried out. The accountability policy also requires that audit trail itself be
protected from unauthorized access and modification. The principle of least privilege assists
in tracing the actions to particular entities, as it increases the granularity of accountability.
Associating specific actions with system entities, and ultimately with users, and making the
audit trail secure against unauthorized access and modifications provide non-repudiation
because once an action is recorded, it is not possible to change the audit trail. Another
pimportant function that accountability and traceability serves is in the routine and forensic
analysis of events associated with the violation of security policy. Analysis of audit logs may lic
provide additional information that may be helpful in determining the path or component
that allowed the violation of the security policy and the actions of individuals associated with n
the violation of the security policy.

l|(23) eSECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  SECURE DEFAULTS
eAssignment: organization-Implement the security design principle of secure defaults in [
odefined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of secure defaults states that the default configuration of a system
g(including its constituent subsystems, components, and mechanisms) reflects a restrictive
fand conservative enforcement of security policy. The principle of secure defaults applies to r
the initial (i.e., default) configuration of a system as well as to the security engineering and
design of access control and other security functions that follow a “deny unless explicitly
authorized” strategy. The initial configuration aspect of this principle requires that any “as s
shipped” configuration of a system, subsystem, or system component does not aid in the d
i.violation of the security policy and can prevent the system from operating in the default
gconfiguration for those cases where the security policy itself requires configuration by the
0operational user.
Restrictive defaults mean that the system will operate “as-shipped” with adequate self-
Nprotection and be able to prevent security breaches before the intended security policy and
system configuration is established. In cases where the protection provided by the “as-T
shipped” product is inadequate, stakeholders assess the risk of using it prior to establishing a
8secure initial state. Adherence to the principle of secure defaults guarantees that a system is
established in a secure state upon successfully completing initialization. In situations where -
the system fails to complete initialization, either it will perform a requested operation using
secure defaults or it will not perform the operation. Refer to the principles of continuous
protection and secure failure and recovery that parallel this principle to provide the ability to
detect and recover from failure.
The security engineering approach to this principle states that security mechanisms deny
requests unless the request is found to be well-formed and consistent with the security
policy. The insecure alternative is to allow a request unless it is shown to be inconsistent
with the policy. In a large system, the conditions that are satisfied to grant a request that is
denied by default are often far more compact and complete than those that would need to
be checked in order to deny a request that is granted by default.

|(24) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES SECURE FAILURE AND RECOVERY
Assignment: Implement the security design principle of secure failure and recovery in [
organization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of secure failure and recovery states that neither a failure in a
system function or mechanism nor any recovery action in response to failure leads to a
violation of security policy. The principle of secure failure and recovery parallels the principle
of continuous protection to ensure that a system is capable of detecting (within limits) actual
and impending failure at any stage of its operation (i.e., initialization, normal operation,
shutdown, and maintenance) and to take appropriate steps to ensure that security policies
are not violated. In addition, when specified, the system is capable of recovering from
impending or actual failure to resume normal, degraded, or alternative secure operations
while ensuring that a secure state is maintained such that security policies are not violated.
hFailure is a condition in which the behavior of a component deviates from its specified or
expected behavior for an explicitly documented input. Once a failed security function is p
bdetected, the system may reconfigure itself to circumvent the failed component while
amaintaining security and provide all or part of the functionality of the original system, or it
may completely shut itself down to prevent any further violation of security policies. For this
isto occur, the reconfiguration functions of the system are designed to ensure continuous
venforcement of security policy during the various phases of reconfiguration.
bAnother technique that can be used to recover from failures is to perform a rollback to a
secure state (which may be the initial state) and then either shutdown or replace the service f
or component that failed such that secure operations may resume. Failure of a component e
may or may not be detectable to the components using it. The principle of secure failure f
indicates that components fail in a state that denies rather than grants access. For example,
ga nominally “atomic” operation interrupted before completion does not violate security
fpolicy and is designed to handle interruption events by employing higher-level atomicity and r
rollback mechanisms (e.g., transactions). If a service is being used, its atomicity properties
are well-documented and characterized so that the component availing itself of that service
can detect and handle interruption events appropriately. For example, a system is designed s
to gracefully respond to disconnection and support resynchronization and data consistency d
i.after disconnection.
1Failure protection strategies that employ replication of policy enforcement mechanisms,
6sometimes called defense in depth, can allow the system to continue in a secure state even
when one mechanism has failed to protect the system. If the mechanisms are similar,
Nhowever, the additional protection may be illusory, as the adversary can simply attack in
series. Similarly, in a networked system, breaking the security on one system or service may T
enable an attacker to do the same on other similar replicated systems and services. By
8employing multiple protection mechanisms whose features are significantly different, the
possibility of attack replication or repetition can be reduced. Analyses are conducted to -
weigh the costs and benefits of such redundancy techniques against increased resource
usage and adverse effects on the overall system performance. Additional analyses are
conducted as the complexity of these mechanisms increases, as could be the case for
dynamic behaviors. Increased complexity generally reduces trustworthiness. When a
resource cannot be continuously protected, it is critical to detect and repair any security
breaches before the resource is once again used in a secure context.

Discussion:  The principle of economic security states that security mechanisms are not
costlier than the potential damage that could occur from a security breach. This is the
security-relevant form of the cost-benefit analyses used in risk management. The cost
assumptions of cost-benefit analysis prevent the system designer from incorporating
security mechanisms of greater strength than necessary, where strength of mechanism is
proportional to cost. The principle of economic security also requires analysis of the benefits
of assurance relative to the cost of that assurance in terms of the effort expended to obtain
relevant and credible evidence as well as the necessary analyses to assess and draw
trustworthiness and risk conclusions from the evidence.

|(26) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES  PERFORMANCE SECURITY
Assignment: Implement the security design principle of performance security in [
horganization-defined systems or system components].
Discussion:  The principle of performance security states that security mechanisms are
constructed so that they do not degrade system performance unnecessarily. Stakeholder lic
and system design requirements for performance and security are precisely articulated and t
nprioritized. For the system implementation to meet its design requirements and be found
acceptable to stakeholders (i.e., validation against stakeholder requirements), the designers
adhere to the specified constraints that capability performance needs place on protection a
la computationally intensive security services (e.g., cryptography) needs. The overall impact of
are assessed and demonstrated to pose no significant impact to higher-priority performance
econsiderations or are deemed to provide an acceptable trade-off of performance for
otrustworthy protection. The trade-off considerations include less computationally intensive
security services unless they are unavailable or insufficient. The insufficiency of a security h
rservice is determined by functional capability and strength of mechanism. The strength of g
mechanism is selected with respect to security requirements, performance-critical overhead f
issues (e.g., cryptographic key management), and an assessment of the capability of the m
threat. h
The principle of performance security leads to the incorporation of features that help in the :
enforcement of security policy but incur minimum overhead, such as low-level hardware
omechanisms upon which higher-level services can be built. Such low-level mechanisms are
usually very specific, have very limited functionality, and are optimized for performance. For /
example, once access rights to a portion of memory is granted, many systems use hardware .
mechanisms to ensure that all further accesses involve the correct memory address and 2
/access mode. Application of this principle reinforces the need to design security into the N
system from the ground up and to incorporate simple mechanisms at the lower layers that
Scan be used as building blocks for higher-level mechanisms.

Discussion:  The principle of human factored security states that the user interface for
security functions and supporting services is intuitive, user-friendly, and provides feedback
for user actions that affect such policy and its enforcement. The mechanisms that enforce
security policy are not intrusive to the user and are designed not to degrade user efficiency.
Security policy enforcement mechanisms also provide the user with meaningful, clear, and
relevant feedback and warnings when insecure choices are being made. Particular attention
is given to interfaces through which personnel responsible for system administration and
operation configure and set up the security policies. Ideally, these personnel are able to

understand the impact of their choices. Personnel with system administrative and
operational responsibilities are able to configure systems before start-up and administer
them during runtime with confidence that their intent is correctly mapped to the system’s
mechanisms. Security services, functions, and mechanisms do not impede or unnecessarily
complicate the intended use of the system. There is a trade-off between system usability
and the strictness necessary for security policy enforcement. If security mechanisms are
frustrating or difficult to use, then users may disable them, avoid them, or use them in ways
inconsistent with the security requirements and protection needs that the mechanisms were

Discussion:  The principle of repeatable and documented procedures states that the r

dcomponent created earlier, which may be in widespread use. In the case of other system

cycle process such that the introduction of unspecified functionality is prevented.

the authoritative (and potentially misleading) specification.
Finally, modifications to an existing system component are easier when there are detailed
specifications that describe its current design instead of studying source code or schematics
to try to understand how it works. Procedural rigor helps ensure that security functional and
assurance requirements have been satisfied, and it contributes to a better-informed basis
for the determination of trustworthiness and risk posture. Procedural rigor is commensurate
with the degree of assurance desired for the system. If the required trustworthiness of the
system is low, a high level of procedural rigor may add unnecessary cost, whereas when high
trustworthiness is critical, the cost of high procedural rigor is merited.
