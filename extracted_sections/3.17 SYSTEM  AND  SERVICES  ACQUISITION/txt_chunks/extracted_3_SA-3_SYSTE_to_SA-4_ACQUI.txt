rAssignment: organization-defined system a.Acquire, develop, and manage the system using [ e
development life cycle] that incorporates information security and privacy considerations; o
b.Define and document information security and privacy roles and responsibilities throughout
gthe system development life cycle;
oc.Identify individuals having information security and privacy roles and responsibilities; and   m
d.Integrate the organizational information security and privacy risk management process into
system development life cycle activities. s
oDiscussion:  A system development life cycle process provides the foundation for the successful
development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. The integration of r
1security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational
principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls 6
within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security
Nand privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical mission and business

test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior
8agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy
architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to -
ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational
systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key
security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to
conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.
The effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise architecture also
helps to ensure that important security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout the
system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational mission and
business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security and
privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture, consistent with the risk management
strategy of the organization. Because the system development life cycle involves multiple
organizations, (e.g., external suppliers, developers, integrators, service providers), acquisition

Control Enhancements:
| (1) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE  MANAGE PREPRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT
Protect system preproduction environments commensurate with risk throughout the
system development life cycle for the system, system component, or system service.
Discussion:  The preproduction environment includes development, test, and integration
environments.The program protection planning processes established by the Department of
Defense are examples of managing the preproduction environment for defense contractors.
hCriticality analysis and the application of controls on developers also contribute to a more
secure system development environment. p

i|o (2) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE  USE OF LIVE OR OPERATIONAL DATA
is(a)Approve, document, and control the use of live data in preproduction environments
vfor the system, system component, or system service; and
(b)Protect preproduction environments for the system, system component, or system  b
le within the service at the same impact or classification level as any live data in use
preproduction environments.
fDiscussion:  Live data is also referred to as operational data. The use of live or operational
data in preproduction (i.e., development, test, and integration) environments can result in
significant risks to organizations. In addition, the use of personally identifiable information in
ftesting, research, and training increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of such r
information. Therefore, it is important for the organization to manage any additional risks
that may result from the use of live or operational data. Organizations can minimize such t
srisks by using test or dummy data during the design, development, and testing of systems,
/ dRisk assessment techniques may be used to system components, and system services.

/Plan for and implement a technology refresh schedule for the system throughout the N
Ssystem development life cycle.
Discussion:  Technology refresh planning may encompass hardware, software, firmware,
processes, personnel skill sets, suppliers, service providers, and facilities. The use of obsolete 8
0or nearing obsolete technology may increase the security and privacy risks associated with
3unsupported components, counterfeit or repurposed components, components unable to
implement security or privacy requirements, slow or inoperable components, components
from untrusted sources, inadvertent personnel error, or increased complexity. Technology
refreshes typically occur during the operations and maintenance stage of the system
development life cycle.
