The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps\nto ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as\npossible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional\napproaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three\napproaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a\nvariety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary\nanalyzers.\nVulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports,\nprotocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow\ncontrol mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly.

Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and\nmay be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring tools that\nfacilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-\nvalidated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open\nVulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources\nfor vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the\nNational Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments, such as red team exercises, provide\nadditional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using\nscanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n(CVSS).\nVulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security T\nivulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as s\npublishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification u\nlauthorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally ic\ntexpect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public\nvulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are\nreported directly to the organization for remediation. a\nlOrganizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as \u201cbug bounties\u201d) to a\nlfurther encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty e\nrprograms can be tailored to the organization\u2019s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or\nover a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group.\nOrganizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously and could choose to offer c\npartially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security vulnerabilities\nefrom privileged vantage points.\nm, Related Controls:  CA-2, CA-7, CA-8, CM-2, CM-4, CM-6, CM-8, RA-2, RA-3, SA-11, SA-15, SC-38\nhSI-2, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SR-11.\nControl Enhancements::\ni| (1).

S\n.Discussion:  Due to the complexity of modern software, systems, and other factors, new 8\n0vulnerabilities are discovered on a regular basis. It is important that newly discovered\n3vulnerabilities are added to the list of vulnerabilities to be scanned to ensure that the\norganization can take steps to mitigate those vulnerabilities in a timely manner.\nRelated Controls:  SI-5.\n|  (3) VULNERABILITY MONITORING AND SCANNING  BREADTH AND DEPTH OF COVERAGE\nDefine the breadth and depth of vulnerability scanning coverage.\nDiscussion:  The breadth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as a\npercentage of components within the system, by the particular types of systems, by the\ncriticality of systems, or by the number of vulnerabilities to be checked. Conversely, the\ndepth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as the level of the system design\nthat the organization intends to monitor (e.g., component, module, subsystem, element).\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 243\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOrganizations can determine the sufficiency of vulnerability scanning coverage with regard\nto its risk tolerance and other factors.

Corrective actions include\nnotifying appropriate organizational personnel, removing designated information, or is\nchanging the system to make the designated information less relevant or attractive to\nadversaries.

Organizations can use\nattack trees to show how hostile activities by adversaries interact and combine to produce\nadverse impacts or negative consequences to systems and organizations. Such information,\ntogether with correlated data from vulnerability scanning tools, can provide greater clarity\nregarding multi-vulnerability and multi-hop attack vectors. The correlation of vulnerability\nscanning information is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older T\nitechnologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). s\nDuring such transitions, some system components may inadvertently be unmanaged and u\nlcreate opportunities for adversary exploitation. ic\nRelated Controls:  None. i\nis |  (11) VULNERABILITY MONITORING AND SCANNINGPUBLIC DISCLOSURE PROGRAM\nEstablish a public reporting channel for receiving reports of vulnerabilities in i\norganizational systems and system components.\neDiscussion:  The reporting channel is publicly discoverable and contains clear language\noauthorizing good-faith research and the disclosure of vulnerabilities to the organization. The\norganization does not condition its authorization on an expectation of indefinite non-h\nrdisclosure to the public by the reporting entity but may request a specific time period to\nproperly remediate the vulnerability.\nRelated Controls:  None.\npReferences:  [ISO 29147], [SP 800-40], [SP 800-53A], [SP 800-70], [SP 800-115], [SP 800-126], [IR\n/7788], [IR 8011-4], [IR 8023]. /"
