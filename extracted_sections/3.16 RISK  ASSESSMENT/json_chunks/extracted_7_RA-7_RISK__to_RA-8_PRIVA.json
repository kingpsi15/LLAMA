The risk tolerance of the\norganization influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response addresses the need to\ndetermine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones\nentry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it may be possible to\nmitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed.\nHowever, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the mitigation cannot be completed\nimmediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.\niRelated Controls:  CA-5, IR-9, PM-4, PM-28, RA-2, RA-3, SR-2. s\nbControl Enhancements:  None.\ntReferences:  [FIPS 199], [FIPS 200], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-160-1]. i"
