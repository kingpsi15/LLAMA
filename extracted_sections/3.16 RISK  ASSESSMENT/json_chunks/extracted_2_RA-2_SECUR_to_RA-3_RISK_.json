Organizations that desire additional granularity in the system impact\ndesignations for risk-based decision-making, can further partition the systems into sub-\n5categories of the initial system categorization. For example, an impact-level prioritization on\n5a moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems,\nmoderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. Impact-level prioritization and\nthe resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to focus their\ninvestments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in\nresponding to identified risks. Impact-level prioritization can also be used to determine\nthose systems that may be of heightened interest or value to adversaries or represent a\ncritical loss to the federal enterprise, sometimes described as high value assets. For such\nhigh value assets, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation, and\ninformation exchanges. Systems with high value assets can be prioritized by partitioning\nhigh-impact systems into low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 239\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAlternatively, organizations can apply the guidance in [CNSSI 1253] for security objective-\nrelated categorization.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  [FIPS 199], [FIPS 200], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-60-1], [SP 800-\n60-2], [SP 800-160-1], [CNSSI 1253], [NARA CUI]."
