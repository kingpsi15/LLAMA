A privacy impact assessment is both an analysis and a formal document that details\nthe process and the outcome of the analysis. /\nOrganizations conduct and develop a privacy impact assessment with sufficient clarity and T\nspecificity to demonstrate that the organization fully considered privacy and incorporated\n8appropriate privacy protections from the earliest stages of the organization\u2019s activity and\nthroughout the information life cycle. In order to conduct a meaningful privacy impact -\nassessment, the organization\u2019s senior agency official for privacy works closely with program\nmanagers, system owners, information technology experts, security officials, counsel, and other\nrelevant organization personnel. Moreover, a privacy impact assessment is not a time-restricted\nactivity that is limited to a particular milestone or stage of the information system or personally\nidentifiable information life cycles. Rather, the privacy analysis continues throughout the system\nand personally identifiable information life cycles. Accordingly, a privacy impact assessment is a\nliving document that organizations update whenever changes to the information technology,\nchanges to the organization\u2019s practices, or other factors alter the privacy risks associated with\nthe use of such information technology.\nTo conduct the privacy impact assessment, organizations can use security and privacy risk\nassessments. Organizations may also use other related processes that may have different names,\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 246\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nincluding privacy threshold analyses. A privacy impact assessment can also serve as notice to the\npublic regarding the organization\u2019s practices with respect to privacy. Although conducting and\npublishing privacy impact assessments may be required by law, organizations may develop such\npolicies in the absence of applicable laws.
