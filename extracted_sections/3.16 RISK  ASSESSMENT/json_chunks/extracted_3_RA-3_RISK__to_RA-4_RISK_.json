Risk\nassessments also consider risk from external parties, including contractors who operate systems\n6on behalf of the organization, individuals who access organizational systems, service providers,\nand outsourcing entities. 8\nSOrganizations can conduct risk assessments at all three levels in the risk management hierarchy\n.(i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any S\nstage in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various .\nsteps in the Risk Management Framework, including preparation, categorization, control 0\nselection, control implementation, control assessment, authorization, and control monitoring. 3\nRisk assessment is an ongoing activity carried out throughout the system development life cycle.\nRisk assessments can also address information related to the system, including system design,\nthe intended use of the system, testing results, and supply chain-related information or artifacts.\nRisk assessments can play an important role in control selection processes, particularly during\nand in the earliest phases of capability determination. the application of tailoring guidance\nRelated Controls:  CA-3, CA-6, CM-4, CM-13, CP-6, CP-7, IA-8, MA-5, PE-3, PE-8, PE-18, PL-2, PL-\n10, PL-11, PM-8, PM-9, PM-28, PT-2, PT-7, RA-2, RA-5, RA-7, SA-8, SA-9, SC-38, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) RISK ASSESSMENT  SUPPLY CHAIN RISK ASSESSMENT\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 240\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAssignment: organization-defined systems, (a)Assess supply chain risks associated with [\nsystem components, and system services]; and\nAssignment: organization-defined (b)Update the supply chain risk assessment [\nfrequency], when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain, or when\nchanges to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions may\nnecessitate a change in the supply chain.\nDiscussion:  Supply chain-related events include disruption, use of defective components,\ninsertion of counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery\npractices, and insertion of malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on the\nconfidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system and its information and, therefore, can\nalso adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or\nreputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The\nsupply chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point T\niduring the system life cycle. An analysis of supply chain risk can help an organization identify s\nsystems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.  u\nlicRelated Controls:  RA-2, RA-9, PM-17, PM-30, SR-2.\n|-n (2) RISK ASSESSMENT  USE OF ALLSOURCE INTELLIGENCE\nUse all-source intelligence to assist in the analysis of risk. a\niDiscussion:  Organizations employ all-source intelligence to inform engineering, acquisition, la\nand risk management decisions. All-source intelligence consists of information derived from le\nfall available sources, including publicly available or open-source information, measurement r\nand signature intelligence, human intelligence, signals intelligence, and imagery intelligence.\nAll-source intelligence is used to analyze the risk of vulnerabilities (both intentional and\naunintentional) from development, manufacturing, and delivery processes, people, and the\nenvironment. The risk analysis may be performed on suppliers at multiple tiers in the supply e\nrchain sufficient to manage risks. Organizations may develop agreements to share all-source o\nintelligence information or resulting decisions with other organizations, as appropriate. :\ntRelated Controls:  None. p\n|d (3) RISK ASSESSMENT  DYNAMIC THREAT AWARENESS\noAssignment: Determine the current cyber threat environment on an ongoing basis using [\n/organization-defined means]. 1\n6Discussion:  The threat awareness information that is gathered feeds into the organization\u2019s\ninformation security operations to ensure that procedures are updated in response to the 8\nchanging threat environment. For example, at higher threat levels, organizations may\nTchange the privilege or authentication thresholds required to perform certain operations.\nPRelated Controls:  AT-2.\n0| (4) RISK ASSESSMENT  PREDICTIVE CYBER ANALYTICS\nEmploy the following advanced automation and analytics capabilities to predict and r\nAssignment: organization-defined systems or system componentsidentify risks to []:\nAssignment: organization-defined advanced automation and analytics capabilities[].\nDiscussion:  A properly resourced Security Operations Center (SOC) or Computer Incident\nResponse Team (CIRT) may be overwhelmed by the volume of information generated by the\nproliferation of security tools and appliances unless it employs advanced automation and\nanalytics to analyze the data. Advanced automation and analytics capabilities are typically\nsupported by artificial intelligence concepts, including machine learning. Examples include\nAutomated Threat Discovery and Response (which includes broad-based collection, context-\nbased analysis, and adaptive response capabilities), automated workflow operations, and\nNote, however, that sophisticated adversaries may be able machine assisted decision tools.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 241\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nto extract information related to analytic parameters and retrain the machine learning to\nclassify malicious activity as benign.
