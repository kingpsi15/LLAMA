  "content": "RA-9 CRITICALITY ANALYSIS T\nControl:  Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for p\nbAssignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services[] at\nAssignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle[]. a\nDiscussion:  Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant\nprotections. For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and a\nainforms the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components\nand functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies, b\nstandards, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and\ncomponent dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to e\nidentify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the f\nhidentification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the\ngspecific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and\nffirmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared r\nby many components within and  external to the system.\ntThe operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality,\n:including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-/\nosystems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical\nsystem components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that r\nsuch components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact 1\nof a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the 6\n2system that contains the components and functions.\nICriticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or S\nupgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the system development life cycle, organizations .\nmay be able to modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and\n0functions, such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality\n5analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors. In\naddition to criticality analysis for systems, system components, and system services, criticality 5\nanalysis of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of\n. security categorization in RA-2\nRelated Controls:  CP-2, PL-2, PL-8, PL-11, PM-1, PM-11, RA-2, SA-8, SA-15, SA-20, SR-5.\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [IR 8179]."
