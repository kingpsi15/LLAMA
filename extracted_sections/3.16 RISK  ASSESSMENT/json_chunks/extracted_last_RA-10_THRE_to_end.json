Cyber threat hunting involves proactively searching organizational systems, networks,\nand infrastructure for advanced threats. The objective is to track and disrupt cyber adversaries as\nearly as possible in the attack sequence and to measurably improve the speed and accuracy of\norganizational responses. Indications of compromise include unusual network traffic, unusual file\nchanges, and the presence of malicious code. Threat hunting teams leverage existing threat h\nintelligence and may create new threat intelligence, which is shared with peer organizations,\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAO), Information Sharing and Analysis Centers b\n(ISAC), and relevant government departments and agencies. a\nRelated Controls:  CA-2, CA-7, CA-8, RA-3, RA-5, RA-6, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:  None. v\nReferences:  [SP 800-30].b\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 248"
