RA-2 SECURITY CATEGORIZATION
Control:
a.Categorize the system and information it processes, stores, and transmits;
b.Document the security categorization results, including supporting rationale, in the security
plan for the system; and
c.Verify that the authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative reviews
and approves the security categorization decision.
Discussion:  Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts or negative consequences
to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information
and systems are compromised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Security
categorization is also a type of asset loss characterization in systems security engineering T
iprocesses that is carried out throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations can s

|-1 (1) SECURITY CATEGORIZATION  IMPACTLEVEL PRIORITIZATION
Conduct an impact-level prioritization of organizational systems to obtain additional 0
8granularity on system impact levels.
IDiscussion:  Organizations apply the “high-water mark” concept to each system categorized S
.in accordance with [FIPS 199], resulting in systems designated as low impact, moderate
impact, or high impact. Organizations that desire additional granularity in the system impact
designations for risk-based decision-making, can further partition the systems into sub-
5categories of the initial system categorization. For example, an impact-level prioritization on
5a moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems,
moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. Impact-level prioritization and
the resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to focus their
investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in
responding to identified risks. Impact-level prioritization can also be used to determine
those systems that may be of heightened interest or value to adversaries or represent a
critical loss to the federal enterprise, sometimes described as high value assets. For such
high value assets, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation, and
information exchanges. Systems with high value assets can be prioritized by partitioning
high-impact systems into low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems.
