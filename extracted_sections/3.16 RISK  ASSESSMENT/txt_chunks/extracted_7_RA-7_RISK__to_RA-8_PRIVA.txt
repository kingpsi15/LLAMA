RA-7 RISK RESPONSE
Control:  Respond to findings from security and privacy assessments, monitoring, and audits in
accordance with organizational risk tolerance.
Discussion:  Organizations have many options for responding to risk including mitigating risk by
implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls, accepting risk with appropriate
justification or rationale, sharing or transferring risk, or avoiding risk. The risk tolerance of the
organization influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response addresses the need to
determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones
entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it may be possible to
mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed.
However, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the mitigation cannot be completed
immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.
