RA-3 RISK ASSESSMENT
Control:
a.Conduct a risk assessment, including:
1.Identifying threats to and vulnerabilities in the system;
2.Determining the likelihood and magnitude of harm from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the system, the information it
processes, stores, or transmits, and any related information; and
3.Determining the likelihood and impact of adverse effects on individuals arising from the
nprocessing of personally identifiable information;
ab.Integrate risk assessment results and risk management decisions from the organization and
mission or business process perspectives with system-level risk assessments; i
leSelection: security and privacy plans; risk assessment c.Document risk assessment results in [
ereport;Assignment: organization-defined document []];
fAssignment: organization-defined frequencyd.Review risk assessment results [];
Assignment: organization-defined personnel or re.Disseminate risk assessment results to [
roles]; and
Assignment: organization-defined frequencyf.Update the risk assessment [] or when there are
significant changes to the system, its environment of operation, or other conditions that may t
simpact the security or privacy state of the system.
Discussion:  Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to
rorganizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Risk
assessments also consider risk from external parties, including contractors who operate systems
6on behalf of the organization, individuals who access organizational systems, service providers,
and outsourcing entities. 8
SOrganizations can conduct risk assessments at all three levels in the risk management hierarchy
.(i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any S
stage in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various .
steps in the Risk Management Framework, including preparation, categorization, control 0
selection, control implementation, control assessment, authorization, and control monitoring. 3
Risk assessment is an ongoing activity carried out throughout the system development life cycle.
Risk assessments can also address information related to the system, including system design,
the intended use of the system, testing results, and supply chain-related information or artifacts.
Risk assessments can play an important role in control selection processes, particularly during
and in the earliest phases of capability determination. the application of tailoring guidance

Assignment: organization-defined systems, (a)Assess supply chain risks associated with [
system components, and system services]; and
Assignment: organization-defined (b)Update the supply chain risk assessment [
frequency], when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain, or when
changes to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions may
necessitate a change in the supply chain.
Discussion:  Supply chain-related events include disruption, use of defective components,
insertion of counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery
practices, and insertion of malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system and its information and, therefore, can
also adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The
supply chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point T
iduring the system life cycle. An analysis of supply chain risk can help an organization identify s
systems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.  u

|-n (2) RISK ASSESSMENT  USE OF ALLSOURCE INTELLIGENCE
Use all-source intelligence to assist in the analysis of risk. a
iDiscussion:  Organizations employ all-source intelligence to inform engineering, acquisition, la
and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence consists of information derived from le
fall available sources, including publicly available or open-source information, measurement r
and signature intelligence, human intelligence, signals intelligence, and imagery intelligence.
All-source intelligence is used to analyze the risk of vulnerabilities (both intentional and
aunintentional) from development, manufacturing, and delivery processes, people, and the
environment. The risk analysis may be performed on suppliers at multiple tiers in the supply e
rchain sufficient to manage risks. Organizations may develop agreements to share all-source o
intelligence information or resulting decisions with other organizations, as appropriate. :

/organization-defined means]. 1
6Discussion:  The threat awareness information that is gathered feeds into the organizationâ€™s
information security operations to ensure that procedures are updated in response to the 8
changing threat environment. For example, at higher threat levels, organizations may
Tchange the privilege or authentication thresholds required to perform certain operations.

Discussion:  A properly resourced Security Operations Center (SOC) or Computer Incident
Response Team (CIRT) may be overwhelmed by the volume of information generated by the
proliferation of security tools and appliances unless it employs advanced automation and
analytics to analyze the data. Advanced automation and analytics capabilities are typically
supported by artificial intelligence concepts, including machine learning. Examples include
Automated Threat Discovery and Response (which includes broad-based collection, context-
based analysis, and adaptive response capabilities), automated workflow operations, and
