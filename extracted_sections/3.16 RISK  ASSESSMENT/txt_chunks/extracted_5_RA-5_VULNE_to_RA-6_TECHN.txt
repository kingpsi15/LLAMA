Discussion:  Security categorization of information and systems guides the frequency and 2
/comprehensiveness of vulnerability monitoring (including scans). Organizations determine the N
Srequired vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of
. infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), vulnerabilities—such asS
.networked printers, scanners, and copiers—are not overlooked. The capability to readily update
vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new 0
helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by scanning methods are developed3
employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps
to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as
possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional
approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three
approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a
variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary
analyzers.
Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports,
protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow
control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability

monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation
to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and
may be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring tools that
facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-
validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open
Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources
for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments, such as red team exercises, provide
additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using
scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS).
Vulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security T
ivulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as s
publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification u
lauthorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally ic
texpect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public
vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are
reported directly to the organization for remediation. a
lOrganizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as “bug bounties”) to a
lfurther encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty e
rprograms can be tailored to the organization’s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or
over a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group.
Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously and could choose to offer c
partially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security vulnerabilities
efrom privileged vantage points.

|  (3) VULNERABILITY MONITORING AND SCANNING  BREADTH AND DEPTH OF COVERAGE
Define the breadth and depth of vulnerability scanning coverage.
Discussion:  The breadth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as a
percentage of components within the system, by the particular types of systems, by the
criticality of systems, or by the number of vulnerabilities to be checked. Conversely, the
depth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as the level of the system design
that the organization intends to monitor (e.g., component, module, subsystem, element).

Assignment: Determine information about the system that is discoverable and take [

Discussion:  Discoverable information includes information that adversaries could obtain
without compromising or breaching the system, such as by collecting information that the
system is exposing or by conducting extensive web searches. Corrective actions include
notifying appropriate organizational personnel, removing designated information, or is
changing the system to make the designated information less relevant or attractive to
adversaries. This enhancement excludes intentionally discoverable information that may be lic
part of a decoy capability (e.g., honeypots, honeynets, or deception nets) deployed by the t

Correlate the output from vulnerability scanning tools to determine the presence of multi-
vulnerability and multi-hop attack vectors.
Discussion:  An attack vector is a path or means by which an adversary can gain access to a
system in order to deliver malicious code or exfiltrate information. Organizations can use
attack trees to show how hostile activities by adversaries interact and combine to produce
adverse impacts or negative consequences to systems and organizations. Such information,
together with correlated data from vulnerability scanning tools, can provide greater clarity
regarding multi-vulnerability and multi-hop attack vectors. The correlation of vulnerability
scanning information is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older T
itechnologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). s
During such transitions, some system components may inadvertently be unmanaged and u
lcreate opportunities for adversary exploitation. ic
