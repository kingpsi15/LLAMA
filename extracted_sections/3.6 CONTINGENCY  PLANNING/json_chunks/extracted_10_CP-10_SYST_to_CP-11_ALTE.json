  "content": "CP-10 SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION\nControl:  Provide for the recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state within\nAssignment: organization-defined time period consistent with recovery time and recovery point [\nobjectives] after a disruption, compromise, or failure.\nDiscussion:  Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational mission\nand business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for\nreturning systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect\nmission and business priorities; recovery point, recovery time, and reconstitution objectives; and\norganizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes\nthe deactivation of interim system capabilities that may have been needed during recovery\noperations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored system capabilities,\nreestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, system reauthorization (if required), and\nhactivities to prepare the system and organization for future disruptions, breaches, compromises,\nor failures. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities can include automated mechanisms and p\nbOrganizations establish recovery time and recovery point objectives as part manual procedures.\naof contingency planning.\nnRelated Controls:  CP-2, CP-4, CP-6, CP-7, CP-9, IR-4, SA-8, SC-24, SI-13.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION  CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTINGb\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CP-4.] f\n|o (2) SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION  TRANSACTION RECOVERY\nhImplement transaction recovery for systems that are transaction-based.\nDiscussion:  Transaction-based systems include database management systems and e\nrtransaction processing systems.
