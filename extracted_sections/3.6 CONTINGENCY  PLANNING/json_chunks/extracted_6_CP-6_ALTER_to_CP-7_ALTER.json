  "content": "CP-6 ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE\nControl:  m\na.Establish an alternate storage site, including necessary agreements to permit the storage  t\nsand retrieval of system backup information; and\nb.Ensure that the alternate storage site provides controls equivalent to that of the primary\nrsite.\nDiscussion:  Alternate storage sites are geographically distinct from primary storage sites and\nmaintain duplicate copies of information and data if the primary storage site is not available.\nSimilarly, alternate processing sites provide processing capability if the primary processing site is /\nSnot available. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency requirements\n.may be considered alternate storage sites. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements S\ninclude environmental conditions at the alternate sites, access rules for systems and facilities, .\nphysical and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery and retrieval 0\nof backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that\n5organizations can maintain essential mission and business functions despite compromise, failure,\nor disruption in organizational systems.\nRelated Controls:  CP-2, CP-7, CP-8, CP-9, CP-10, MP-4, MP-5, PE-3, SC-36, SI-13.\nControl Enhancements:\n|  (1) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE  SEPARATION FROM PRIMARY SITE\nIdentify an alternate storage site that is sufficiently separated from the primary storage\nsite to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.\nDiscussion:  Threats that affect alternate storage sites are defined in organizational risk\nassessments and include natural disasters, structural failures, hostile attacks, and errors of\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 121\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nomission or commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient degree of\nseparation between primary and alternate storage sites based on the types of threats that\nare of concern. For threats such as hostile attacks, the degree of separation between sites is\nless relevant.\n.Related Controls:  RA-3\n| (2) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE  RECOVERY TIME AND RECOVERY POINT OBJECTIVES\nConfigure the alternate storage site to facilitate recovery operations in accordance with\nrecovery time and recovery point objectives.\nDiscussion:  Organizations establish recovery time and recovery point objectives as part of\ncontingency planning.Configuration of the alternate storage site includes physical facilities\nand the systems supporting recovery operations that ensure accessibility and correct\nexecution.\niRelated Controls:  None.s\nb| (3) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE  ACCESSIBILITY\nIdentify potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the event of an t\narea-wide disruption or disaster and outline explicit mitigation actions.\naDiscussion:  Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in\ngeographic scope with such determinations made by organizations based on organizational i\nbassessments of risk. Explicit mitigation actions include duplicating backup information at\nother alternate storage sites if access problems occur at originally designated alternate sites f\neor planning for physical access to retrieve backup information if electronic accessibility to\nfthe alternate site is disrupted.\naRelated Controls:  RA-3.\nReferences:  [SP 800-34]. f"
