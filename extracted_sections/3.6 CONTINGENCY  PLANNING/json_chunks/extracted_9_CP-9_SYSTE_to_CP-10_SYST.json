Independent and specialized tests can be used for each of the aspects of\nreliability. For example, decrypting and transporting (or transmitting) a random sample of\nobackup files from the alternate storage or backup site and comparing the information to the\n:same information at the primary processing site can provide such assurance.\npRelated Controls:  CP-4.\n| (2) SYSTEM BACKUP  TEST RESTORATION USING SAMPLING o\nUse a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected system functions as part r\n1of contingency plan testing.\nDiscussion:  Organizations need assurance that system functions can be restored correctly 0\n8and can support established organizational missions. To ensure that the selected system\nduring contingency plan testing, a sample of backup functions are thoroughly exercisedI\ninformation is retrieved to determine whether the functions are operating as intended.\nPOrganizations can determine the sample size for the functions and backup information\nbased on the level of assurance needed. 0\n5Related Controls:  CP-4.\n|  (3) SYSTEM BACKUP  SEPARATE STORAGE FOR CRITICAL INFORMATION\nAssignment: organization-defined critical system software and Store backup copies of [\nother security-related information] in a separate facility or in a fire rated container that is\nnot collocated with the operational system.\nDiscussion:  Separate storage for critical information applies to all critical information\nregardless of the type of backup storage media. Critical system software includes operating\nsystems, middleware, cryptographic key management systems, and intrusion detection\nsystems. Security-related information includes inventories of system hardware, software,\nand firmware components. Alternate storage sites, including geographically distributed\narchitectures, serve as separate storage facilities for organizations.

Individuals deleting or\nodestroying backup information possess the skills or expertise to determine if the proposed\ndeletion or destruction of information reflects organizational policies and procedures. Dual /\nauthorization may also be known as two-person control. To reduce the risk of collusion, .\norganizations consider rotating dual authorization duties to other individuals. 2\nNRelated Controls:  AC-3, AC-5, MP-2.\n|.

The strength of mechanisms selected is\ncommensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Cryptographic\nprotection applies to system backup information in storage at both primary and alternate\nlocations. Organizations that implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect information\nat rest also consider cryptographic key management solutions.\nRelated Controls:  SC-12, SC-13, SC-28.\nReferences:  [FIPS 140-3], [FIPS 186-4], [SP 800-34], [SP 800-130], [SP 800-152].\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 127\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________"
