Alternate telecommunications services reflect\nthe continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business\nlicfunctions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify\nidifferent time periods for primary or alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services o\ninclude additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits or lines, network-based is\napproaches to telecommunications, or the use of satellites. Organizations consider factors such\nas availability, quality of service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications i\nagreements. le\neRelated Controls:  CP-2, CP-6, CP-7, CP-11, SC-7.\nControl Enhancements:\nr| (1) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  PRIORITY OF SERVICE PROVISIONSg\n(a)Develop primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain  r\npriority-of-service provisions in accordance with availability requirements (including\nrecovery time objectives); and t\n(b)Request Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used  /\nofor national security emergency preparedness if the primary and/or alternate\ntelecommunications services are provided by a common carrier. r\nDiscussion:  Organizations consider the potential mission or business impact in situations 0\nwhere telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar 0\n8priority of service provisions. Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal\nCommunications Commission (FCC) program that directs telecommunications service I\nproviders (e.g., wireline and wireless phone companies) to give preferential treatment to\nPusers enrolled in the program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored\nfollowing a disruption of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and policies 0\n-for the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages the TSP program. 5\nrThe TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a major disaster or attack taking\nplace. Federal sponsorship is required to enroll in the TSP program.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (2) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE\nObtain alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single\npoint of failure with primary telecommunications services.\nDiscussion:  In certain circumstances, telecommunications service providers or services may\nshare the same physical lines, which increases the vulnerability of a single failure point. It is\nimportant to have provider transparency for the actual physical transmission capability for\ntelecommunication services.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 124\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (3) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  SEPARATION OF PRIMARY AND ALTERNATE PROVIDERS\nObtain alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from\nprimary service providers to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.\nDiscussion:  Threats that affect telecommunications services are defined in organizational\nassessments of risk and include natural disasters, structural failures, cyber or physical\nattacks, and errors of omission or commission. Organizations can reduce common\nsusceptibilities by minimizing shared infrastructure among telecommunications service\nproviders and achieving sufficient geographic separation between services. Organizations\nmay consider using a single service provider in situations where the service provider can\nprovide alternate telecommunications services that meet the separation needs addressed in\nthe risk assessment.\nRelated Controls:  None. is\n| (4) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  PROVIDER CONTINGENCY PLANb\na(a)Require primary and alternate telecommunications service providers to have\ncontingency plans; n\na(b)Review provider contingency plans to ensure that the plans meet organizational\ncontingency requirements; and i\nleAssignment: (c)Obtain evidence of contingency testing and training by providers [\norganization-defined frequency]. e\nDiscussion:  Reviews of provider contingency plans consider the proprietary nature of such\nplans. In some situations, a summary of provider contingency plans may be sufficient h\nevidence for organizations to satisfy the review requirement. Telecommunications service g\nproviders may also participate in ongoing disaster recovery exercises in coordination with f\nmthe Department of Homeland Security and state and local governments. Organizations may\nhuse these types of activities to satisfy evidentiary requirements related to service provider\ncontingency plan reviews, testing, and training.\ndRelated Controls:  CP-3, CP-4.\n|r (5) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  ALTERNATE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE TESTING g\n0Assignment: organization-defined frequencyTest alternate telecommunication services [].\nDiscussion:  Alternate telecommunications services testing is arranged through contractual\n/agreements with service providers. The testing may occur in parallel with normal operations\nSto ensure that there is no degradation in organizational missions or functions.\nRelated Controls:  CP-3.\n0References:  [SP 800-34]."
