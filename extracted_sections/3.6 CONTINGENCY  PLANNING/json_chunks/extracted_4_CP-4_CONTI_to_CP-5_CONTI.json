Organizations conduct\ntesting based on the requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the\neffects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals due to contingency operations.\nOrganizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective\nactions.\nRelated Controls:  AT-3, CP-2, CP-3, CP-8, CP-9, IR-3, IR-4, PL-2, PM-14, SR-2.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING  COORDINATE WITH RELATED PLANS\nCoordinate contingency plan testing with organizational elements responsible for related is\nplans.\nliDiscussion:  Plans related to contingency planning for organizational systems include c\ntBusiness Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of Operations Plans, Crisis i\nCommunications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber Incident Response Plans, and\nOccupant Emergency Plans. Coordination of contingency plan testing does not require a\naorganizations to create organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such\nbelements with specific plans. However, it does require that if such organizational elements\nare responsible for related plans, organizations coordinate with those elements.\nRelated Controls:  IR-8, PM-8.\n| h(2) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING  ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE\nTest the contingency plan at the alternate processing site:\n(a)To familiarize contingency personnel with the facility and available resources; and o\n(b)To evaluate the capabilities of the alternate processing site to support contingency\noperations. p\nDiscussion:  Conditions at the alternate processing site may be significantly different than /\nthe conditions at the primary site. Having the opportunity to visit the alternate site and i.\nexperience the actual capabilities available at the site can provide valuable information on g\npotential vulnerabilities that could affect essential organizational mission and business 0\nfunctions. The on-site visit can also provide an opportunity to refine the contingency plan to 0\n8address the vulnerabilities discovered during testing.\nRelated Controls:  CP-7.S\n| (3) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING  AUTOMATED TESTINGP\n0Assignment: organization-defined automated Test the contingency plan using [\nmechanisms5].\nDiscussion:  Automated mechanisms facilitate thorough and effective testing of contingency\nplans by providing more complete coverage of contingency issues, selecting more realistic\ntest scenarios and environments, and effectively stressing the system and supported mission\nand business functions.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| (4) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING  FULL RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION\nInclude a full recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state as part of\ncontingency plan testing.\nDiscussion:  Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational\nmission and business functions.

The mechanisms used by the organization could disrupt system functions or\nsystem services in many ways, including terminating or disabling critical system components,\nchanging the configuration of system components, degrading critical functionality (e.g., is\nrestricting network bandwidth), or altering privileges. Automated, on-going, and simulated\ncyber-attacks and service disruptions can reveal unexpected functional dependencies and lic\nhelp the organization determine its ability to ensure resilience in the face of an actual cyber-t\nnattack.\nRelated Controls:  None. a\nlReferences:  [FIPS 199], [SP 800-34], [SP 800-84], [SP 800-160-2]. a"
