Contingency planning\nIaddresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes\nwhen systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the .\nPsystem development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be\n0designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans\nreflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need 5\nto fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery 5\nobjectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,\nguidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.\nActions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown,\nfallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for\nwhen systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling\nactivities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in\nthe event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an\n. incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4(5)\nIncident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in\nIR (Incident Response) family. the\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 116\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nRelated Controls:  CP-3, CP-4, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, CP-9, CP-10, CP-11, CP-13, IR-4, IR-6, IR-8, IR-9,\nMA-6, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, PL-2, PM-8, PM-11, SA-15, SA-20, SC-7, SC-23, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) CONTINGENCY PLAN  COORDINATE WITH RELATED PLANS\nCoordinate contingency plan development with organizational elements responsible for\nrelated plans.\nDiscussion:  Plans that are related to contingency plans include Business Continuity Plans,\nDisaster Recovery Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Continuity of Operations Plans, Crisis\nCommunications Plans, Insider Threat Implementation Plans, Data Breach Response Plans,\nCyber Incident Response Plans, Breach Response Plans, and Occupant Emergency Plans.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n| i(2) CONTINGENCY PLAN  CAPACITY PLANNINGs\nuConduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing,\nlitelecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations. c\noDiscussion:  Capacity planning is needed because different threats can result in a reduction\niof the available processing, telecommunications, and support services intended to support s\nessential mission and business functions. Organizations anticipate degraded operations v\niduring contingency operations and factor the degradation into capacity planning. For la\ncapacity planning, environmental support refers to any environmental factor for which the le\norganization determines that it needs to provide support in a contingency situation, even if r\nin a degraded state. Such determinations are based on an organizational assessment of risk,\nsystem categorization (impact level), and organizational risk tolerance. c\nRelated Controls:  PE-11, PE-12, PE-13, PE-14, PE-18, SC-5. g\n|o (3) CONTINGENCY PLAN  RESUME MISSION AND BUSINESS FUNCTIONS\nSelection: all; essentialPlan for the resumption of [] mission and business functions within h\npAssignment: organization-defined time period[] of contingency plan activation.\n/Discussion:  Organizations may choose to conduct contingency planning activities to resume d\nimission and business functions as part of business continuity planning or as part of business .\ngimpact analyses. Organizations prioritize the resumption of mission and business functions.\n0The time period for resuming mission and business functions may be dependent on the\n0severity and extent of the disruptions to the system and its supporting infrastructure.\n/Related Controls:  None.

When mission and business i\nfunctions are dependent on external service providers, organizations coordinate contingency\nplanning activities with the external entities to ensure that the individual plans reflect the a\noverall contingency needs of the organization.\nRelated Controls:  SA-9. le\ne| (8) CONTINGENCY PLAN  IDENTIFY CRITICAL ASSETS e\nfSelection: all; essentialIdentify critical system assets supporting [] mission and business\nfunctions. a\neDiscussion:  Organizations may choose to identify critical assets as part of criticality analysis,\nbusiness continuity planning, or business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical o\nsystem assets so that additional controls can be employed (beyond the controls routinely :\ntimplemented) to help ensure that organizational mission and business functions can t\ncontinue to be conducted during contingency operations. The identification of critical :\ninformation assets also facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical o\nosystem assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include system\n/components, information technology services, information technology products, and 1\n.mechanisms. Operational aspects include procedures (i.e., manually executed operations) 6\n2and personnel (i.e., individuals operating technical controls and/or executing manual\nprocedures). Organizational program protection plans can assist in identifying critical assets.
