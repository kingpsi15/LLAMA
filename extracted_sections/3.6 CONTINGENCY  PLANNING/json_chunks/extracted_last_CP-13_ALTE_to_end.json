S\n8Discussion:  Use of alternative security mechanisms supports system resiliency, contingency\nplanning, and continuity of operations. To ensure mission and business continuity, organizations -\ncan implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. The mechanisms may be less r\neffective than the primary mechanisms. However, having the capability to readily employ\nalternative or supplemental mechanisms enhances mission and business continuity that might\notherwise be adversely impacted if operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of\nimplementing the functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide\nsuch alternative capabilities, the alternative or supplemental mechanisms are only applied to\ncritical security capabilities provided by systems, system components, or system services. For\nexample, an organization may issue one-time pads to senior executives, officials, and system\nadministrators if multi-factor tokens\u2014the standard means for achieving secure authentication\u2014\nare compromised.\nRelated Controls:  CP-2, CP-11, SI-13.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 129\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nControl Enhancements:  None\nReferences:  None.\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 130"
