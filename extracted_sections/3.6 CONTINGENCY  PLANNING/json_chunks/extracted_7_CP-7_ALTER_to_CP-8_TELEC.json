The alternate\nprocessing capability may be addressed using a physical processing site or other alternatives,\nsuch as failover to a cloud-based service provider or other internally or externally provided\nprocessing service. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency\nrequirements may also be considered alternate processing sites. Controls that are covered by\nalternate processing site agreements include the environmental conditions at alternate sites,\naccess rules, physical and environmental protection requirements, and the coordination for the\ntransfer and assignment of personnel. Requirements are allocated to alternate processing sites\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 122\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nthat reflect the requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business\nfunctions despite disruption, compromise, or failure in organizational systems.\n.

Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient\ndegree of separation between primary and alternate processing sites based on the types of\nhthreats that are of concern. For threats such as hostile attacks, the degree of separation\nbetween sites is less relevant. p\nRelated Controls:  RA-3. lic\ni|o (2) ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE  ACCESSIBILITY\nisIdentify potential accessibility problems to alternate processing sites in the event of an\nvarea-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.\nDiscussion:  Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in b\ngeographic scope with such determinations made by organizations based on organizational\nassessments of risk.\nfRelated Controls:  RA-3.\n| r(3) ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE  PRIORITY OF SERVICE\nfDevelop alternate processing site agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in\nmaccordance with availability requirements (including recovery time objectives).\nDiscussion:  Priority of service agreements refer to negotiated agreements with service t\nsproviders that ensure that organizations receive priority treatment consistent with their\ndavailability requirements and the availability of information resources for logical alternate\ni.
