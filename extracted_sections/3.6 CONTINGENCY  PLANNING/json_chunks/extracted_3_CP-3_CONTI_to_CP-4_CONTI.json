For example, some individuals may only need to know when\nand where to report for duty during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected;\nsystem administrators may require additional training on how to establish systems at alternate\nprocessing and storage sites; and organizational officials may receive more specific training on\nhow to conduct mission-essential functions in designated off-site locations and how to establish\ncommunications with other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on contingency-\nrelated activities. Training for contingency roles or responsibilities reflects the specific continuity\nrequirements in the contingency plan. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency h\ntraining content include, but are not limited to, contingency plan testing or an actual contingency\nb(lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in\nlaws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. At the a\nodiscretion of the organization, participation in a contingency plan test or exercise, including\nilessons learned sessions subsequent to the test or exercise, may satisfy contingency plan training s\nrequirements. v\nRelated Controls:  AT-2, AT-3, AT-4, CP-2, CP-4, CP-8, IR-2, IR-4, IR-9. b\nrControl Enhancements:\n| (1) CONTINGENCY TRAINING  SIMULATED EVENTSf\naIncorporate simulated events into contingency training to facilitate effective response by\npersonnel in crisis situations.e\noDiscussion:  The use of simulated events creates an environment for personnel to experience\n:actual threat events, including cyber-attacks that disable websites, ransomware attacks that\ntencrypt organizational data on servers, hurricanes that damage or destroy organizational p\n:facilities, or hardware or software failures. /\nRelated Controls:  None. i.\n|/ (2) CONTINGENCY TRAINING  MECHANISMS USED IN TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS1\n6Employ mechanisms used in operations to provide a more thorough and realistic\ncontingency training environment. 8\nDiscussion:  Operational mechanisms refer to processes that have been established to I\naccomplish an organizational goal or a system that supports a particular organizational\nPmission or business objective.
