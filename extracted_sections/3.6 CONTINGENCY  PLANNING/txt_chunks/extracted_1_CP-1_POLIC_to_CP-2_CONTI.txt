Discussion:  Contingency planning policy and procedures address the controls in the CP family s
/that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an d
iimportant factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute .
gto security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs
0collaborate on the development of contingency planning policy and procedures. Security and
privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and 0
8may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be
Iincluded as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies
that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and .
privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
0describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and 5
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to 5
contingency planning policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security
incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy
or procedure.
