8Discussion:  Use of alternative security mechanisms supports system resiliency, contingency
planning, and continuity of operations. To ensure mission and business continuity, organizations -
can implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. The mechanisms may be less r
effective than the primary mechanisms. However, having the capability to readily employ
alternative or supplemental mechanisms enhances mission and business continuity that might
otherwise be adversely impacted if operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of
implementing the functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide
such alternative capabilities, the alternative or supplemental mechanisms are only applied to
critical security capabilities provided by systems, system components, or system services. For
example, an organization may issue one-time pads to senior executives, officials, and system
administrators if multi-factor tokens—the standard means for achieving secure authentication—
are compromised.
