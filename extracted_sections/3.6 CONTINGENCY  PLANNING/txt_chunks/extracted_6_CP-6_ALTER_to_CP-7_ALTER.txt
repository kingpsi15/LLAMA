CP-6 ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE
Control:  m
a.Establish an alternate storage site, including necessary agreements to permit the storage  t
sand retrieval of system backup information; and
b.Ensure that the alternate storage site provides controls equivalent to that of the primary
rsite.
Discussion:  Alternate storage sites are geographically distinct from primary storage sites and
maintain duplicate copies of information and data if the primary storage site is not available.
Similarly, alternate processing sites provide processing capability if the primary processing site is /
Snot available. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency requirements
.may be considered alternate storage sites. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements S
include environmental conditions at the alternate sites, access rules for systems and facilities, .
physical and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery and retrieval 0
of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that
5organizations can maintain essential mission and business functions despite compromise, failure,
or disruption in organizational systems.

Control Enhancements:
|  (1) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE  SEPARATION FROM PRIMARY SITE
Identify an alternate storage site that is sufficiently separated from the primary storage
site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.
Discussion:  Threats that affect alternate storage sites are defined in organizational risk
assessments and include natural disasters, structural failures, hostile attacks, and errors of

omission or commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient degree of
separation between primary and alternate storage sites based on the types of threats that
are of concern. For threats such as hostile attacks, the degree of separation between sites is
less relevant.

| (2) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE  RECOVERY TIME AND RECOVERY POINT OBJECTIVES
Configure the alternate storage site to facilitate recovery operations in accordance with
recovery time and recovery point objectives.
Discussion:  Organizations establish recovery time and recovery point objectives as part of
contingency planning.Configuration of the alternate storage site includes physical facilities
and the systems supporting recovery operations that ensure accessibility and correct
execution.
iRelated Controls:  None.s
b| (3) ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE  ACCESSIBILITY
Identify potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the event of an t
area-wide disruption or disaster and outline explicit mitigation actions.
aDiscussion:  Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in
geographic scope with such determinations made by organizations based on organizational i
bassessments of risk. Explicit mitigation actions include duplicating backup information at
other alternate storage sites if access problems occur at originally designated alternate sites f
eor planning for physical access to retrieve backup information if electronic accessibility to
fthe alternate site is disrupted.
