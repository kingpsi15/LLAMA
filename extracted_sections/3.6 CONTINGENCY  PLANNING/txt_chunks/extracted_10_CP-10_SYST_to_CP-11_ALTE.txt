CP-10 SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION
Control:  Provide for the recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state within
Assignment: organization-defined time period consistent with recovery time and recovery point [
objectives] after a disruption, compromise, or failure.
Discussion:  Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational mission
and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for
returning systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect
mission and business priorities; recovery point, recovery time, and reconstitution objectives; and
organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes
the deactivation of interim system capabilities that may have been needed during recovery
operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored system capabilities,
reestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, system reauthorization (if required), and
hactivities to prepare the system and organization for future disruptions, breaches, compromises,
or failures. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities can include automated mechanisms and p
