d.Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup information.
Discussion:  System-level information includes system state information, operating system
software, middleware, application software, and licenses. User-level information includes
information other than system-level information. Mechanisms employed to protect the integrity
of system backups include digital signatures and cryptographic hashes. Protection of system

requirements in contingency plans as well as other organizational requirements for backing up
information. Organizations may be subject to laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or
policies with requirements regarding specific categories of information (e.g., personal health
information). Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and h
legal counsel regarding such requirements.

oControl Enhancements:
| (1) SYSTEM BACKUP  TESTING FOR RELIABILITY AND INTEGRITY a
Assignment: organization-defined frequencyiTest backup information [] to verify media la
reliability and information integrity. le
rDiscussion:  Organizations need assurance that backup information can be reliably retrieved. e
Reliability pertains to the systems and system components where the backup information is
cstored, the operations used to retrieve the information, and the integrity of the information
being retrieved. Independent and specialized tests can be used for each of the aspects of
reliability. For example, decrypting and transporting (or transmitting) a random sample of
obackup files from the alternate storage or backup site and comparing the information to the
:same information at the primary processing site can provide such assurance.
pRelated Controls:  CP-4.
| (2) SYSTEM BACKUP  TEST RESTORATION USING SAMPLING o
Use a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected system functions as part r
1of contingency plan testing.
Discussion:  Organizations need assurance that system functions can be restored correctly 0
8and can support established organizational missions. To ensure that the selected system
during contingency plan testing, a sample of backup functions are thoroughly exercisedI
information is retrieved to determine whether the functions are operating as intended.
POrganizations can determine the sample size for the functions and backup information
based on the level of assurance needed. 0

|  (3) SYSTEM BACKUP  SEPARATE STORAGE FOR CRITICAL INFORMATION
Assignment: organization-defined critical system software and Store backup copies of [
other security-related information] in a separate facility or in a fire rated container that is
not collocated with the operational system.
Discussion:  Separate storage for critical information applies to all critical information
regardless of the type of backup storage media. Critical system software includes operating
systems, middleware, cryptographic key management systems, and intrusion detection
systems. Security-related information includes inventories of system hardware, software,
and firmware components. Alternate storage sites, including geographically distributed
architectures, serve as separate storage facilities for organizations. Organizations may

storage sites (e.g., data centers). The General Services Administration (GSA) establishes
standards and specifications for security and fire rated containers.

| (5) SYSTEM BACKUP  TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE
Assignment: Transfer system backup information to the alternate storage site [
organization-defined time period and transfer rate consistent with the recovery time and
recovery point objectives].
Discussion:  System backup information can be transferred to alternate storage sites either
helectronically or by the physical shipment of storage media.

| (6) SYSTEM BACKUP  REDUNDANT SECONDARY SYSTEM a
nConduct system backup by maintaining a redundant secondary system that is not
collocated with the primary system and that can be activated without loss of information
or disruption to operations. a
Discussion:  The effect of system backup can be achieved by maintaining a redundant b
secondary system that mirrors the primary system, including the replication of information.
If this type of redundancy is in place and there is sufficient geographic separation between e
the two systems, the secondary system can also serve as the alternate processing site. f

|  (7) SYSTEM BACKUP  DUAL AUTHORIZATION FOR DELETION OR DESTRUCTIONf
Assignment: organization-Enforce dual authorization for the deletion or destruction of [
defined backup information].
Discussion:  Dual authorization ensures that deletion or destruction of backup information :
cannot occur unless two qualified individuals carry out the task. Individuals deleting or
odestroying backup information possess the skills or expertise to determine if the proposed
deletion or destruction of information reflects organizational policies and procedures. Dual /
authorization may also be known as two-person control. To reduce the risk of collusion, .
organizations consider rotating dual authorization duties to other individuals. 2

0Assignment: organization-defined backup informationmodification of [].
Discussion:  The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the r
confidentiality and integrity of backup information. The strength of mechanisms selected is
commensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Cryptographic
protection applies to system backup information in storage at both primary and alternate
locations. Organizations that implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect information
at rest also consider cryptographic key management solutions.
