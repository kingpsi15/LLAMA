CP-8 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
Control:  Establish alternate telecommunications services, including necessary agreements to
Assignment: organization-defined system operationspermit the resumption of [] for essential
Assignment: organization-defined time periodmission and business functions within [] when the
primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or alternate
processing or storage sites.
Discussion:  Telecommunications services (for data and voice) for primary and alternate
processing and storage sites are in scope for CP-8. Alternate telecommunications services reflect
the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business
licfunctions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify
idifferent time periods for primary or alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services o
include additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits or lines, network-based is
approaches to telecommunications, or the use of satellites. Organizations consider factors such
as availability, quality of service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications i
agreements. le

Control Enhancements:
r| (1) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  PRIORITY OF SERVICE PROVISIONSg
(a)Develop primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain  r
priority-of-service provisions in accordance with availability requirements (including
recovery time objectives); and t
(b)Request Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used  /
ofor national security emergency preparedness if the primary and/or alternate
telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier. r
Discussion:  Organizations consider the potential mission or business impact in situations 0
where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar 0
8priority of service provisions. Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) program that directs telecommunications service I
providers (e.g., wireline and wireless phone companies) to give preferential treatment to
Pusers enrolled in the program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored
following a disruption of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and policies 0
-for the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages the TSP program. 5
rThe TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a major disaster or attack taking
place. Federal sponsorship is required to enroll in the TSP program.
Related Controls:  None.
| (2) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE
Obtain alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single
point of failure with primary telecommunications services.
Discussion:  In certain circumstances, telecommunications service providers or services may
share the same physical lines, which increases the vulnerability of a single failure point. It is
important to have provider transparency for the actual physical transmission capability for
telecommunication services.

| (3) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  SEPARATION OF PRIMARY AND ALTERNATE PROVIDERS
Obtain alternate telecommunications services from providers that are separated from
primary service providers to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.
Discussion:  Threats that affect telecommunications services are defined in organizational
assessments of risk and include natural disasters, structural failures, cyber or physical
attacks, and errors of omission or commission. Organizations can reduce common
susceptibilities by minimizing shared infrastructure among telecommunications service
providers and achieving sufficient geographic separation between services. Organizations
may consider using a single service provider in situations where the service provider can
provide alternate telecommunications services that meet the separation needs addressed in
the risk assessment.

leAssignment: (c)Obtain evidence of contingency testing and training by providers [
organization-defined frequency]. e
Discussion:  Reviews of provider contingency plans consider the proprietary nature of such
plans. In some situations, a summary of provider contingency plans may be sufficient h
evidence for organizations to satisfy the review requirement. Telecommunications service g
providers may also participate in ongoing disaster recovery exercises in coordination with f
mthe Department of Homeland Security and state and local governments. Organizations may
huse these types of activities to satisfy evidentiary requirements related to service provider
contingency plan reviews, testing, and training.
