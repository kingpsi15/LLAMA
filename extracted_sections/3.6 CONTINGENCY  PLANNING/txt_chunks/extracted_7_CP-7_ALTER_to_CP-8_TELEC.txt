Discussion:  Alternate processing sites are geographically distinct from primary processing sites
and provide processing capability if the primary processing site is not available. The alternate
processing capability may be addressed using a physical processing site or other alternatives,
such as failover to a cloud-based service provider or other internally or externally provided
processing service. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency
requirements may also be considered alternate processing sites. Controls that are covered by
alternate processing site agreements include the environmental conditions at alternate sites,
access rules, physical and environmental protection requirements, and the coordination for the
transfer and assignment of personnel. Requirements are allocated to alternate processing sites

Control Enhancements:
| (1) ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE  SEPARATION FROM PRIMARY SITE
Identify an alternate processing site that is sufficiently separated from the primary
processing site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.
Discussion:  Threats that affect alternate processing sites are defined in organizational
assessments of risk and include natural disasters, structural failures, hostile attacks, and
errors of omission or commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient
degree of separation between primary and alternate processing sites based on the types of
hthreats that are of concern. For threats such as hostile attacks, the degree of separation
between sites is less relevant. p

i|o (2) ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE  ACCESSIBILITY
isIdentify potential accessibility problems to alternate processing sites in the event of an
varea-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.
Discussion:  Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in b
geographic scope with such determinations made by organizations based on organizational
assessments of risk.

fDevelop alternate processing site agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in
maccordance with availability requirements (including recovery time objectives).
Discussion:  Priority of service agreements refer to negotiated agreements with service t
sproviders that ensure that organizations receive priority treatment consistent with their
davailability requirements and the availability of information resources for logical alternate

| (4) ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE  PREPARATION FOR USE/
Prepare the alternate processing site so that the site can serve as the operational site
Ssupporting essential mission and business functions.
8Discussion:  Site preparation includes establishing configuration settings for systems at the
alternate processing site consistent with the requirements for such settings at the primary
site and ensuring that essential supplies and logistical considerations are in place.

Plan and prepare for circumstances that preclude returning to the primary processing site.
Discussion:  There may be situations that preclude an organization from returning to the
primary processing site such as if a natural disaster (e.g., flood or a hurricane) damaged or
