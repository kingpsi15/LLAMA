CP-2 CONTINGENCY PLAN
Control:
a.Develop a contingency plan for the system that:
1.Identifies essential mission and business functions and associated contingency
requirements;
2.Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;
3.Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact
information;
4.Addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite a system
disruption, compromise, or failure;
i5.Addresses eventual, full system restoration without deterioration of the controls  s
originally planned and implemented; u
6.Addresses the sharing of contingency information; and  a

Discussion:  Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving 0
8continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning
Iaddresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes
when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the .
Psystem development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be
0designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans
reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need 5
to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery 5
objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.
Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown,
fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for
when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling
activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in
the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an
. incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4(5)
Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in
IR (Incident Response) family. the

Related Controls:  None.
| i(2) CONTINGENCY PLAN  CAPACITY PLANNINGs
uConduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing,
litelecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations. c
oDiscussion:  Capacity planning is needed because different threats can result in a reduction
iof the available processing, telecommunications, and support services intended to support s
essential mission and business functions. Organizations anticipate degraded operations v
iduring contingency operations and factor the degradation into capacity planning. For la
capacity planning, environmental support refers to any environmental factor for which the le
organization determines that it needs to provide support in a contingency situation, even if r
in a degraded state. Such determinations are based on an organizational assessment of risk,
system categorization (impact level), and organizational risk tolerance. c

Coordinate the contingency plan with the contingency plans of external service providers
to ensure that contingency requirements can be satisfied. is
uDiscussion:  When the capability of an organization to carry out its mission and business
lifunctions is dependent on external service providers, developing a comprehensive and c
ttimely contingency plan may become more challenging. When mission and business i
functions are dependent on external service providers, organizations coordinate contingency
planning activities with the external entities to ensure that the individual plans reflect the a
overall contingency needs of the organization.

eDiscussion:  Organizations may choose to identify critical assets as part of criticality analysis,
business continuity planning, or business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical o
system assets so that additional controls can be employed (beyond the controls routinely :
timplemented) to help ensure that organizational mission and business functions can t
continue to be conducted during contingency operations. The identification of critical :
information assets also facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical o
osystem assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include system
/components, information technology services, information technology products, and 1
.mechanisms. Operational aspects include procedures (i.e., manually executed operations) 6
2and personnel (i.e., individuals operating technical controls and/or executing manual
procedures). Organizational program protection plans can assist in identifying critical assets. N
If critical assets are resident within or supported by external service providers, organizations
