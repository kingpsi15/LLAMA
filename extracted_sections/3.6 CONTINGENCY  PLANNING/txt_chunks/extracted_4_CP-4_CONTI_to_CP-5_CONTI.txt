c.Initiate corrective actions, if needed.
Discussion:  Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans
and identify potential weaknesses include checklists, walk-through and tabletop exercises,
simulations (parallel or full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct
testing based on the requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the
effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals due to contingency operations.
Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective
actions.

Control Enhancements:
| (1) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING  COORDINATE WITH RELATED PLANS
Coordinate contingency plan testing with organizational elements responsible for related is
plans.
liDiscussion:  Plans related to contingency planning for organizational systems include c
tBusiness Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of Operations Plans, Crisis i
Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber Incident Response Plans, and
Occupant Emergency Plans. Coordination of contingency plan testing does not require a
aorganizations to create organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such
belements with specific plans. However, it does require that if such organizational elements
are responsible for related plans, organizations coordinate with those elements.
Related Controls:  IR-8, PM-8.
| h(2) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING  ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE
Test the contingency plan at the alternate processing site:
(a)To familiarize contingency personnel with the facility and available resources; and o
(b)To evaluate the capabilities of the alternate processing site to support contingency
operations. p
Discussion:  Conditions at the alternate processing site may be significantly different than /
the conditions at the primary site. Having the opportunity to visit the alternate site and i.
experience the actual capabilities available at the site can provide valuable information on g
potential vulnerabilities that could affect essential organizational mission and business 0
functions. The on-site visit can also provide an opportunity to refine the contingency plan to 0
8address the vulnerabilities discovered during testing.

| (3) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING  AUTOMATED TESTINGP
0Assignment: organization-defined automated Test the contingency plan using [
mechanisms5].
Discussion:  Automated mechanisms facilitate thorough and effective testing of contingency
plans by providing more complete coverage of contingency issues, selecting more realistic
test scenarios and environments, and effectively stressing the system and supported mission
and business functions.
Related Controls:  None.
| (4) CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING  FULL RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION
Include a full recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state as part of
contingency plan testing.
Discussion:  Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational
mission and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes

defined system or system component] to disrupt and adversely affect the system or system
component.
Discussion:  Often, the best method of assessing system resilience is to disrupt the system in
some manner. The mechanisms used by the organization could disrupt system functions or
system services in many ways, including terminating or disabling critical system components,
changing the configuration of system components, degrading critical functionality (e.g., is
restricting network bandwidth), or altering privileges. Automated, on-going, and simulated
cyber-attacks and service disruptions can reveal unexpected functional dependencies and lic
help the organization determine its ability to ensure resilience in the face of an actual cyber-t
nattack.
