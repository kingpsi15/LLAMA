bDiscussion:  For systems that support critical mission and business functions—including military
operations, civilian space operations, nuclear power plant operations, and air traffic control f
eoperations (especially real-time operational environments)—organizations can identify certain
conditions under which those systems revert to a predefined safe mode of operation. The safe f
mode of operation, which can be activated either automatically or manually, restricts the
goperations that systems can execute when those conditions are encountered. Restriction
fincludes allowing only selected functions to execute that can be carried out under limited power r
or with reduced communications bandwidth.
