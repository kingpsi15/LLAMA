An information security program plan can be represented in a\nsingle document or compilations of documents. Privacy program plans and supply chain risk\n, respectively. management plans are addressed separately in PM-18 and SR-2\nAn information security program plan documents implementation details about program\nmanagement and common controls. The plan provides sufficient information about the controls\n(including specification of parameters for assignment and selection operations, explicitly or by\nreference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the\nplan and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plan is implemented as intended.\nUpdates to information security program plans include organizational changes and problems\nidentified during plan implementation or control assessments.\nProgram management controls may be implemented at the organization level or the mission or\nbusiness process level, and are essential for managing the organization\u2019s information security h\nprogram. Program management controls are distinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid\nbcontrols because program management controls are independent of any particular system.\nTogether, the individual system security plans and the organization-wide information security a\noprogram plan provide complete coverage for the security controls employed within the\niorganization.s\naCommon controls available for inheritance by organizational systems are documented in an\nappendix to the organization\u2019s information security program plan unless the controls are b\nincluded in a separate security plan for a system. The organization-wide information security\nprogram plan indicates which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls. e\nEvents that may precipitate an update to the information security program plan include, but are c\nanot limited to, organization-wide assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or\nechanges in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\nmRelated Controls:  PL-2, PM-18, PM-30, RA-9, SI-12, SR-2.\nControl Enhancements:  None. t\n/References:  [FISMA], [OMB A-130], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39]. d"
