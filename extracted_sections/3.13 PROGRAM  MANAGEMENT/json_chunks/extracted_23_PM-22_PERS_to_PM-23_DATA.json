The information life cycle includes the creation, collection, 6\n2use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposition of personally\nNidentifiable information. Organizational policies and procedures for personally identifiable\ninformation quality management are important because inaccurate or outdated personally T\nidentifiable information maintained by organizations may cause problems for individuals.\n8Organizations consider the quality of personally identifiable information involved in business\nfunctions where inaccurate information may result in adverse decisions or the denial of benefits\n3and services, or the disclosure of the information may cause stigmatization. Correct information,\nin certain circumstances, can cause problems for individuals that outweigh the benefits of\norganizations maintaining the information.

Processes for correcting or deleting data are clearly defined\nand publicly available.
