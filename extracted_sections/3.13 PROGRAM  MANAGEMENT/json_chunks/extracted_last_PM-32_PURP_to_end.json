However,\nover time, systems and system components may be used to support services and functions that\nare outside of the scope of the intended mission or business functions. This can result in\nexposing information resources to unintended environments and uses that can significantly T\niincrease threat exposure. In doing so, the systems are more vulnerable to compromise, which s\ncan ultimately impact the services and functions for which they were intended. This is especially u\nliimpactful for mission-essential services and functions. By analyzing resource use, organizations c\ntcan identify such potential exposures. i\nisRelated Controls:  CA-7, PL-2, RA-3, RA-9.\naControl Enhancements:  None.\nlReferences:  [SP 800-160-1], [SP 800-160-2].e\nCHAPTER THREE    PAGE 221"
