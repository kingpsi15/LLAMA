Privacy program plans can be\nrepresented in single documents or compilations of documents.\nThe senior agency official for privacy is responsible for designating which privacy controls the\norganization will treat as program management, common, system-specific, and hybrid controls.\nPrivacy program plans provide sufficient information about the privacy program management\nand common controls (including the specification of parameters and assignment and selection\noperations explicitly or by reference) to enable control implementations that are unambiguously\ncompliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk incurred if the plans are T\niimplemented as intended. s\nbProgram management controls are generally implemented at the organization level and are\nessential for managing the organization\u2019s privacy program. Program management controls are a\nodistinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid controls because program management\nicontrols are independent of any particular information system. Together, the privacy plans for s\nindividual systems and the organization-wide privacy program plan provide complete coverage v\nlfor the privacy controls employed within the organization. a\nCommon controls are documented in an appendix to the organization\u2019s privacy program plan\nunless the controls are included in a separate privacy plan for a system. The organization-wide e\nprivacy program plan indicates which separate privacy plans contain descriptions of privacy f\nhcontrols.\ne. Related Controls:  PM-8, PM-9, PM-19\nmControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [PRIVACT], [OMB A-130]. t"
