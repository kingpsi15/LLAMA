The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified r\nenvironments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified 1\nand other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls 6\n2to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis\nNof both technical and nontechnical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A\nsenior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to T\nimplement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and\n8analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare department or\nagency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of\n3individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat\nawareness training to employees, receive access to information from offices in the department\nor agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department or agency\ninsider threat posture.\nInsider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations\nmay already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources\nrecords are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some\ntypes of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace, including\nongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues.\nThese precursors can guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts.\nHowever, the use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy.
