  "content": "PM-16 THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM\n:Control:  Implement a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization information-/\nosharing capability for threat intelligence.\ngDiscussion:  Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries,\n0especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be more likely that adversaries can\n0successfully breach or compromise organizational systems. One of the best techniques to\naddress this concern is for organizations to share threat information, including threat events (i.e., /\nItactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that S\norganizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence .\n(i.e., indications and warnings about threats). Threat information sharing may be bilateral or\nmultilateral. Bilateral threat sharing includes government-to-commercial and government-to-\n5government cooperatives. Multilateral threat sharing includes organizations taking part in threat-\n5sharing consortia. Threat information may require special agreements and protection, or it may\nbe freely shared.\nRelated Controls:  IR-4, PM-12.\nControl Enhancements:\n| (1) THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM  AUTOMATED MEANS FOR SHARING THREAT INTELLIGENCE\nEmploy automated mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of sharing threat\nintelligence information.\nDiscussion:  To maximize the effectiveness of monitoring, it is important to know what\nthreat observables and indicators the sensors need to be searching for.
