The senior accountable official for risk management\n(agency head or designated official) aligns information security management processes with\nstrategic, operational, and budgetary planning processes. The risk executive function, led by the\nsenior accountable official for risk management, can facilitate consistent application of the risk\nmanagement strategy organization-wide. The risk management strategy can be informed by\nsecurity and privacy risk-related inputs from other sources, both internal and external to the\norganization, to ensure that the strategy is broad-based and comprehensive. The supply chain\nPM-30 can also provide useful inputs to the organization-risk management strategy described in\nwide risk management strategy.\niRelated Controls:  AC-1, AU-1, AT-1, CA-1, CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CA-7, CM-1, CP-1, IA-1, IR-1, MA-1, s\nMP-1, PE-1, PL-1, PL-2, PM-2, PM-8, PM-18, PM-28, PM-30, PS-1, PT-1, PT-2, PT-3, RA-1, RA-3, u\nlRA-9, SA-1, SA-4, SC-1, SC-38, SI-1, SI-12, SR-1, SR-2. ic\noControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-161], [IR 8023].a"
