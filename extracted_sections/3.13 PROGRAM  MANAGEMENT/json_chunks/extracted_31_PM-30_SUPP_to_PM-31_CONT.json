Supply\n5chain risk management includes considerations of the security and privacy risks associated with\n5the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, and\nsystem services. The supply chain risk management strategy can be incorporated into the\norganization\u2019s overarching risk management strategy and can guide and inform supply chain\npolicies and system-level supply chain risk management plans. In addition, the use of a risk\nexecutive function can facilitate a consistent, organization-wide application of the supply chain\nrisk management strategy. The supply chain risk management strategy is implemented at the\norganization and mission/business levels, whereas the supply chain risk management plan (see\nSR-2) is implemented at the system level.\nRelated Controls:  CM-10, PM-9, SR-1, SR-2, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6, SR-7, SR-8, SR-9, SR-11.\nControl Enhancements:\nCHAPTER THREE    PAGE 219\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n|- (1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY  SUPPLIERS OF CRITICAL OR MISSIONESSENTIAL ITEMS\nIdentify, prioritize, and assess suppliers of critical or mission-essential technologies,\nproducts, and services.\nDiscussion:  The identification and prioritization of suppliers of critical or mission-essential\ntechnologies, products, and services is paramount to the mission/business success of\nSR-6) organizations. The assessment of suppliers is conducted using supplier reviews (see\nand supply chain risk assessment processes (see RA-3(1)).
