Information\nprotection and personally identifiable information processing needs are derived from the mission\nand business needs defined by organizational stakeholders, the mission and business processes\ndesigned to meet those needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information\nprotection and personally identifiable information processing needs determine the required\ncontrols for the organization and the systems. Inherent to defining protection and personally\nidentifiable information processing needs is an understanding of the adverse impact that could\nresult if a compromise or breach of information occurs. The categorization process is used to\nmake such potential impact determinations. Privacy risks to individuals can arise from the T\nicompromise of personally identifiable information, but they can also arise as unintended s\nconsequences or a byproduct of the processing of personally identifiable information at any u\nlstage of the information life cycle. Privacy risk assessments are used to prioritize the risks that ic\ntare created for individuals from system processing of personally identifiable information. These\nrisk assessments enable the selection of the required privacy controls for the organization and\nsystems. Mission and business process definitions and the associated protection requirements a\naare documented in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.\nlRelated Controls:  CP-2, PL-2, PM-7, PM-8, RA-2, RA-3, RA-9, SA-2. e\nControl Enhancements:  None. e\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [FIPS 199],[SP 800-39], [SP 800-60-1], [SP 800-60-2], [SP 800-160-1]. c"
