The process of security and privacy requirements integration also embeds\ninto the enterprise architecture and the organization\u2019s security and privacy architectures\nconsistent with the organizational risk management strategy. For PM-7, security and privacy\narchitectures are developed at a system-of-systems level, representing all organizational\nCHAPTER THREE    PAGE 206\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nsystems. For PL-8, the security and privacy architectures are developed at a level that represents\nan individual system. The system-level architectures are consistent with the security and privacy\narchitectures defined for the organization. Security and privacy requirements and control\nintegration are most effectively accomplished through the rigorous application of the Risk\nSP 800-37] and supporting security standards and guidelines.

Printing or copying is an example of a non-\nessential but supporting service for an organization. Whenever feasible, such supportive but p\nbnon-essential functions or services are not co-located with the functions or services that\nsupport essential mission or business functions. Maintaining such functions on the same a\nsystem or system component increases the attack surface of the organization\u2019s mission-\nisessential functions or services. Moving supportive but non-essential functions to a non-\nvcritical system, system component, or external provider can also increase efficiency by\nlputting those functions or services under the control of individuals or providers who are a\nlsubject matter experts in the functions or services. e\neRelated Controls:  SA-8.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-160-1], [SP 800-160-2]."
