With the growing importance of continuous monitoring\nprograms, the implementation of information security and privacy across the three levels of the\nrisk management hierarchy and the widespread use of common controls, organizations\ncoordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring activities that are routinely conducted as\npart of ongoing assessments supporting a variety of controls. Security and privacy training\nactivities, while focused on individual systems and specific roles, require coordination across all\norganizational elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and activities are informed by\ncurrent threat and vulnerability assessments.\nRelated Controls:  AT-2, AT-3, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3, PM-12, SI-4.\nCHAPTER THREE    PAGE 210\nNISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                               EV                                                                                      ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nControl Enhancements:  None.\nReferences:  [OMB A-130], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-53A], [SP 800-115], [SP 800-137]."
