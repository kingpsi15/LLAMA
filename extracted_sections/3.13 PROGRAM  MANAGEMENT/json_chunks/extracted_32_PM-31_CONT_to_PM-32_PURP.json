The terms \u201ccontinuous\u201d and \u201congoing\u201d imply that organizations assess and monitor 0\n8their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types\nof controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring I\nguide and inform risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs allow\nPorganizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic\nenvironments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, 0\n-and technologies. Having access to security- and privacy-related information on a continuing 5\nrbasis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make\neffective, timely, and informed risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization\ndecisions. To further facilitate security and privacy risk management, organizations consider\naligning organization-defined monitoring metrics with organizational risk tolerance as defined in\nthe risk management strategy.
