PM-31 CONTINUOUS MONITORING STRATEGY
Control:  Develop an organization-wide continuous monitoring strategy and implement  a
ocontinuous monitoring programs that include:
Assignment: a.Establishing the following organization-wide metrics to be monitored: [
organization-defined metrics]; a
Assignment: organization-defined frequenciesb.Establishing [] for monitoring and  le
fAssignment: organization-defined frequencies[] for assessment of control effectiveness; r
c.Ongoing monitoring of organizationally-defined metrics in accordance with the continuous
monitoring strategy; h
d.Correlation and analysis of information generated by control assessments and monitoring; e
me.Response actions to address results of the analysis of control assessment and monitoring
information; and h
Assignment: f.Reporting the security and privacy status of organizational systems to [ :
organization-defined personnel or rolesAssignment: organization-defined frequency] []. o
rDiscussion:  Continuous monitoring at the organization level facilitates ongoing awareness of the g
security and privacy posture across the organization to support organizational risk management 0
decisions. The terms “continuous” and “ongoing” imply that organizations assess and monitor 0
8their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types
of controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring I
guide and inform risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs allow
Porganizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic
environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, 0
-and technologies. Having access to security- and privacy-related information on a continuing 5
rbasis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make
effective, timely, and informed risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization
decisions. To further facilitate security and privacy risk management, organizations consider
aligning organization-defined monitoring metrics with organizational risk tolerance as defined in
the risk management strategy. Monitoring requirements, including the need for monitoring, may
