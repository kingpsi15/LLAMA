5PM-7 ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
Control:  Develop and maintain an enterprise architecture with consideration for information
security, privacy, and the resulting risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation.
Discussion:  The integration of security and privacy requirements and controls into the enterprise
architecture helps to ensure that security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout
the system development life cycle and are explicitly related to the organization’s mission and
business processes. The process of security and privacy requirements integration also embeds
into the enterprise architecture and the organization’s security and privacy architectures
consistent with the organizational risk management strategy. For PM-7, security and privacy
architectures are developed at a system-of-systems level, representing all organizational

an individual system. The system-level architectures are consistent with the security and privacy
architectures defined for the organization. Security and privacy requirements and control
integration are most effectively accomplished through the rigorous application of the Risk

Assignment: organization-defined non-essential functions or servicesOffload [] to other
systems, system components, or an external provider.
Discussion:  Not every function or service that a system provides is essential to
horganizational mission or business functions. Printing or copying is an example of a non-
essential but supporting service for an organization. Whenever feasible, such supportive but p
bnon-essential functions or services are not co-located with the functions or services that
support essential mission or business functions. Maintaining such functions on the same a
system or system component increases the attack surface of the organization’s mission-
isessential functions or services. Moving supportive but non-essential functions to a non-
vcritical system, system component, or external provider can also increase efficiency by
lputting those functions or services under the control of individuals or providers who are a
lsubject matter experts in the functions or services. e
