PM-32 PURPOSING
Assignment: organization-defined systems or systems componentsControl:  Analyze [] supporting
mission essential services or functions to ensure that the information resources are being used
consistent with their intended purpose.
Discussion:  Systems are designed to support a specific mission or business function. However,
over time, systems and system components may be used to support services and functions that
are outside of the scope of the intended mission or business functions. This can result in
exposing information resources to unintended environments and uses that can significantly T
iincrease threat exposure. In doing so, the systems are more vulnerable to compromise, which s
can ultimately impact the services and functions for which they were intended. This is especially u
liimpactful for mission-essential services and functions. By analyzing resource use, organizations c
tcan identify such potential exposures. i
