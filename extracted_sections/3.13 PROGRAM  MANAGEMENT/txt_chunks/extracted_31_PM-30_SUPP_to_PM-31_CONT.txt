cPM-30 SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
gControl:
oa.Develop an organization-wide strategy for managing supply chain risks associated with the
:development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, and
tsystem services; p
b.Implement the supply chain risk management strategy consistently across the organization;  d
iand .
Assignment: 1c.Review and update the supply chain risk management strategy on [
.organization-defined frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes. 6
Discussion:  An organization-wide supply chain risk management strategy includes an
Iunambiguous expression of the supply chain risk appetite and tolerance for the organization, S
acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently .
evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating
0the supply chain risk management strategy, and the associated roles and responsibilities. Supply
5chain risk management includes considerations of the security and privacy risks associated with
5the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, and
system services. The supply chain risk management strategy can be incorporated into the
organizationâ€™s overarching risk management strategy and can guide and inform supply chain
policies and system-level supply chain risk management plans. In addition, the use of a risk
executive function can facilitate a consistent, organization-wide application of the supply chain
risk management strategy. The supply chain risk management strategy is implemented at the
organization and mission/business levels, whereas the supply chain risk management plan (see
SR-2) is implemented at the system level.

|- (1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY  SUPPLIERS OF CRITICAL OR MISSIONESSENTIAL ITEMS
Identify, prioritize, and assess suppliers of critical or mission-essential technologies,
products, and services.
Discussion:  The identification and prioritization of suppliers of critical or mission-essential
technologies, products, and services is paramount to the mission/business success of
SR-6) organizations. The assessment of suppliers is conducted using supplier reviews (see
and supply chain risk assessment processes (see RA-3(1)). An analysis of supply chain risk
can help an organization identify systems or components for which additional supply chain
risk mitigations are required.
