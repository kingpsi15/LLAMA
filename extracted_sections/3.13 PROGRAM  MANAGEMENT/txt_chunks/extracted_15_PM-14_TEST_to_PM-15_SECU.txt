:PM-14 TESTING, TRAINING, AND MONITORING  /
i.Control:
1a.Implement a process for ensuring that organizational plans for conducting security and
6privacy testing, training, and monitoring activities associated with organizational systems:
1.Are developed and maintained; and  /
2.Continue to be executed; and  T
b.Review testing, training, and monitoring plans for consistency with the organizational risk
0management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.
Discussion:  A process for organization-wide security and privacy testing, training, and monitoring
helps ensure that organizations provide oversight for testing, training, and monitoring activities
and that those activities are coordinated. With the growing importance of continuous monitoring
programs, the implementation of information security and privacy across the three levels of the
risk management hierarchy and the widespread use of common controls, organizations
coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring activities that are routinely conducted as
part of ongoing assessments supporting a variety of controls. Security and privacy training
activities, while focused on individual systems and specific roles, require coordination across all
organizational elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and activities are informed by
current threat and vulnerability assessments.
Related Controls:  AT-2, AT-3, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3, PM-12, SI-4.
