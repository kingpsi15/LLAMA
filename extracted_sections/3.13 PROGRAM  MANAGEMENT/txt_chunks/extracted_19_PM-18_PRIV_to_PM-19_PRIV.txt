Discussion:  A privacy program plan is a formal document that provides an overview of an
organization’s privacy program, including a description of the structure of the privacy program,
the resources dedicated to the privacy program, the role of the senior agency official for privacy
and other privacy officials and staff, the strategic goals and objectives of the privacy program,
and the program management controls and common controls in place or planned for meeting
applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risks. Privacy program plans can be
represented in single documents or compilations of documents.
The senior agency official for privacy is responsible for designating which privacy controls the
organization will treat as program management, common, system-specific, and hybrid controls.
Privacy program plans provide sufficient information about the privacy program management
and common controls (including the specification of parameters and assignment and selection
operations explicitly or by reference) to enable control implementations that are unambiguously
compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk incurred if the plans are T
iimplemented as intended. s
bProgram management controls are generally implemented at the organization level and are
essential for managing the organization’s privacy program. Program management controls are a
odistinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid controls because program management
icontrols are independent of any particular information system. Together, the privacy plans for s
individual systems and the organization-wide privacy program plan provide complete coverage v
lfor the privacy controls employed within the organization. a
Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s privacy program plan
unless the controls are included in a separate privacy plan for a system. The organization-wide e
privacy program plan indicates which separate privacy plans contain descriptions of privacy f
hcontrols.
e. Related Controls:  PM-8, PM-9, PM-19
