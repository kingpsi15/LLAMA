Discussion:  Personally identifiable information quality management includes steps that
/organizations take to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable information 1
.throughout the information life cycle. The information life cycle includes the creation, collection, 6
2use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposition of personally
Nidentifiable information. Organizational policies and procedures for personally identifiable
information quality management are important because inaccurate or outdated personally T
identifiable information maintained by organizations may cause problems for individuals.
8Organizations consider the quality of personally identifiable information involved in business
functions where inaccurate information may result in adverse decisions or the denial of benefits
3and services, or the disclosure of the information may cause stigmatization. Correct information,
in certain circumstances, can cause problems for individuals that outweigh the benefits of
organizations maintaining the information. Organizations consider creating policies and
procedures for the removal of such information.
The senior agency official for privacy ensures that practical means and mechanisms exist and are
accessible for individuals or their authorized representativesto seek the correction or deletion of
personally identifiable information. Processes for correcting or deleting data are clearly defined
and publicly available. Organizations use discretion in determining whether data is to be deleted

to record individual objections to the decisions, and a means of requesting reviews of the initial
determinations.
Organizations notify individuals or their designated representatives when their personally
identifiable information is corrected or deleted to provide transparency and confirm the
completed action. Due to the complexity of data flows and storage, other entities may need to
be informed of the correction or deletion. Notice supports the consistent correction and deletion
of personally identifiable information across the data ecosystem.
