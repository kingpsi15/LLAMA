Assignment: organization-defined c.Review and revise the mission and business processes [
frequency].
Discussion:  Protection needs are technology-independent capabilities that are required to
counter threats to organizations, individuals, systems, and the Nation through the compromise
of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, or privacy). Information
protection and personally identifiable information processing needs are derived from the mission
and business needs defined by organizational stakeholders, the mission and business processes
designed to meet those needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information
protection and personally identifiable information processing needs determine the required
controls for the organization and the systems. Inherent to defining protection and personally
identifiable information processing needs is an understanding of the adverse impact that could
result if a compromise or breach of information occurs. The categorization process is used to
make such potential impact determinations. Privacy risks to individuals can arise from the T
icompromise of personally identifiable information, but they can also arise as unintended s
consequences or a byproduct of the processing of personally identifiable information at any u
lstage of the information life cycle. Privacy risk assessments are used to prioritize the risks that ic
tare created for individuals from system processing of personally identifiable information. These
risk assessments enable the selection of the required privacy controls for the organization and
systems. Mission and business process definitions and the associated protection requirements a
aare documented in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.
