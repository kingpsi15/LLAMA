ePM-12 INSIDER THREAT PROGRAM
Control:  Implement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat
incident handling team.
:Discussion:  Organizations that handle classified information are required, under Executive Order /
o13587 [EO 13587] and the National Insider Threat Policy [ODNI NITP], to establish insider threat
programs. The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified r
environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified 1
and other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls 6
2to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis
Nof both technical and nontechnical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A
senior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to T
implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and
8analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare department or
agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of
3individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat
awareness training to employees, receive access to information from offices in the department
or agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department or agency
insider threat posture.
Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations
may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources
records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some
types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace, including
ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues.
These precursors can guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts.
However, the use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy. The
