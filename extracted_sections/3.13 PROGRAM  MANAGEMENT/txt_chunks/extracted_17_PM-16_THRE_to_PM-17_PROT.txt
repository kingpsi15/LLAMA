PM-16 THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM
:Control:  Implement a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization information-/
osharing capability for threat intelligence.
gDiscussion:  Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries,
0especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be more likely that adversaries can
0successfully breach or compromise organizational systems. One of the best techniques to
address this concern is for organizations to share threat information, including threat events (i.e., /
Itactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that S
organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence .
(i.e., indications and warnings about threats). Threat information sharing may be bilateral or
multilateral. Bilateral threat sharing includes government-to-commercial and government-to-
5government cooperatives. Multilateral threat sharing includes organizations taking part in threat-
5sharing consortia. Threat information may require special agreements and protection, or it may
be freely shared.

Employ automated mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of sharing threat
intelligence information.
Discussion:  To maximize the effectiveness of monitoring, it is important to know what
threat observables and indicators the sensors need to be searching for. By using well-
