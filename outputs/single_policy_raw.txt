AC-4 INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT /
oControl:  Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the
/Assignment: organization-defined system and between connected systems based on [1
information flow control policies.].
8Discussion:  Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and
between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to I
subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external
Ptraffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information
from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from 0
-the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based 5
ron data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an 5
CA-3). Transferring information agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see
between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy
policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy
policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy
enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes
prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only),
verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy
domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information

flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy
attributes and labels.
Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms
to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems
and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information
and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices
that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a
packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability
based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or
inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to
information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-
domain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and
stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high-T
iassurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf s
products. Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and u
lDNS). ic

-|  (2) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT  PROCESSING DOMAINS5
5Assignment: organization-defined Use protected processing domains to enforce [
information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.
Discussion:  Protected processing domains within systems are processing spaces that have
controlled interactions with other processing spaces, enabling control of information flows
between these spaces and to/from information objects. A protected processing domain can
be provided, for example, by implementing domain and type enforcement. In domain and
type enforcement, system processes are assigned to domains, information is identified by
types, and information flows are controlled based on allowed information accesses (i.e.,
determined by domain and type), allowed signaling among domains, and allowed process
transitions to other domains.

Discussion:  Organization-defined security or privacy policy filters can address data

check for maximum file lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file types (for structured and
unstructured data). Security or privacy policy filters for data content can check for specific
words, enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data

isdigital information without a data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate

liconveyed by the data or the flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured data consists of c
tbitmap objects that are inherently non-language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files) and i

Discussion:  Attribution is a critical component of a security and privacy concept of
operations. The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing
within systems allows the forensic reconstruction of events and encourages policy
compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations or individuals. Successful
domain authentication requires that system labels distinguish among systems, organizations,
and individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating information.
Attribution also allows organizations to better maintain the lineage of personally identifiable
information processing as it flows through systems and can facilitate consent tracking, as
