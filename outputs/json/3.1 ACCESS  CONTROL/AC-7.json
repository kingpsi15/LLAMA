  "Discussion": "The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent action when the omaximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a is\nalocal or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts\ninitiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,\norganization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ\ndifferent algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those rcomponents.\nResponses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating\nsystem and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the\nnumber of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to a\nanswer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode e\nwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified oInternet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks,\nor applying\nuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)\naddress.",
