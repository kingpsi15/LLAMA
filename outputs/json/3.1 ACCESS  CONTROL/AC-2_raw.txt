      "PolicyName": "ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT",
      "Control": "a.Define and document the types of accounts allowed and specifically prohibited for use within the system;\nb.Assign account managers;\nc.Specify:\n1.Authorized users of the system;\n2.Group and role membership;\n3.Access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and [ p(as required)] for each account;\nd.Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with [ vorganization-defined policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria]; g.Monitor the use of accounts;\nh.Notify account managers and [] within:\n1.[] when accounts are no longer required;\ne.Authorize access to the system based on:\n o.A valid access authorization;\n2.Intended system usage;\nas.Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements [organization-defined frequency];\nl.Establish and implement a process for changing shared or group account authenticators (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group; and l.Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes.",
      "Discussion": "Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, privileged, dynamic...Account management audit records are defined in accordance with AU-2is previewed, analyzed, and reported in accordance with AU-6....Specifying and enforcing usage conditions helps to enforce the principle of least privilege, increase user accountability, and enable effective account monitoring.",
      "Dynamic Privilege Management": "In contrast to access control approaches that employ static accounts and predefined user privileges, dynamic access control approaches rely on runtime access : control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management, such as attribute-based access control...An example of dynamic privilege management is the immediate revocation of privileges from users as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles.",
      "Privileged Roles": "Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key management, account management, database administration, system and network administration, and web administration...A role-based access scheme organizes permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges based on attributes.",
      "Dynamic Account Management": "Approaches for dynamically creating, activating, managing, and deactivating system accounts rely on automatically provisioning the accounts at runtime for entities that were previously unknown...Organizations plan for the dynamic management, creation, activation, and deactivation of system accounts by establishing trust relationships, business rules, and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges.",
      "Restrictions on Use of Shared and Group Accounts": "Before permitting the use of shared or group accounts, organizations consider the increased risk due to the lack of accountability with such accounts.",
      "Usage Conditions": "Specifying and enforcing usage conditions helps to enforce the principle of least privilege, increase user accountability, and enable effective account monitoring...Account monitoring may inadvertently create privacy risks since data collected to identify atypical usage may reveal previously unknown information about the behavior of individuals.",
      "Account Monitoring for Atypical Usage": "Monitor system accounts for atypical usage...Monitoring for atypical usage may reveal rogue behavior by individuals or an attack in progress",
      "Disable Accounts for High-Risk Individuals": "Users who pose a significant security and/or privacy risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Such harm includes adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation",
