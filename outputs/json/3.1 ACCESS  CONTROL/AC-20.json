  "Control": "hSelection (one or more): Establish Assignment: organization-defined terms and conditions;a.[[]\nIdentify Assignment: organization-defined controls asserted to be implemented on external [pbsystems]], consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to:\na\n1.Access the system from external systems;\n2.Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems; v\\lor a",
  "Discussion": "External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems,\nand for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned\nesystems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in\ncommercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;\nsystems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, \ntoperated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems\nalso include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and\nsystems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the\noption to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of\nexternal systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned 1.\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships\nIthat have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be S\nsuch that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may .\nNot be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing\ninformation exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations\nor components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational 5\npersonnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and\nor over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding\nsystem access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be\nuniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.\nTherefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors\nthan on state, local, or tribal governments.",
  "ControlEnhancements": "Use of External Systems  LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE\nPermit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process, store,\nor transmit organization-controlled information only after:\n(a)Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in\nthe organization\u2019s security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans; or\nb)Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the  is\norganizational entity hosting the external system.\ndiscussion: Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using c\nextternal systems may need to access organizational systems. Organizations need assurance i\nthat the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage,\nor otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been a\nimplemented can be achieved by external, independent assessments, attestations, or other\nbmeans, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.",
