      "Control": "a.Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and e implement guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and b.Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections.",
      "Discussion": "Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of \nusers) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access  m :include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks \nt(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted p :VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such / \nconnections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in \naccordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, r \n1and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does \ndo not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect \nthe ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote \naccess controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public \nAuthorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing access. T \nremote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations \nmay use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote \n. Enforcing access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3-\nalready. Remote access control is primarily concerned with ensuring that appropriate access is granted \naccording to the established policies and procedures.",
