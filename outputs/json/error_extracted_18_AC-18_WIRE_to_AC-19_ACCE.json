     "Control": "Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of wireless access; and Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections.",
     "Discussion": "Wireless technologies include microwave, packet radio (ultra-high frequency or very / \nhigh frequency), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide authenticator protection and mutual authentication.\n\nWireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system components represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Disabling wireless capabilities when not needed for essential organizational missions or functions can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.",
