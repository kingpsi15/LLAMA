  "Discussion": "System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash\ndrives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, \nmagnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm.\nPhysically controlling stored media includes conducting inventories, ensuring\nprocedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the library,\nand maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk,\nor cabinet or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate with\nthe security category or classification of the information on the media. Controlled areas are spaces\nthat provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for h\nprotecting information and systems. Fewer controls may be needed for media that contains\nbinformation determined to be in the public domain, publicly releasable, or have limited adverse\nimpacts on organizations, operations, or individuals if accessed by other than authorized a\nopersonnel. In these situations, physical access controls provide adequate protection.",
