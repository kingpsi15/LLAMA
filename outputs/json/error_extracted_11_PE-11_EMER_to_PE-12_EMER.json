      "Control": "Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate [e orderly shutdown of the system; transition of the system to long-term alternate power] in the event of a primary power source loss.",
      "Discussion": "An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism that provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power source. A UPS differs from an emergency power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from unexpected power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut down the system.",
