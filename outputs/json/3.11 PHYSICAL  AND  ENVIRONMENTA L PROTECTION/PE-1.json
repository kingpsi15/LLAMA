  "Discussion": "Physical and environmental protection policy and procedures address the controls in d\nithe PE family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management .\ngstrategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and\nprocedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security\nand privacy programs collaborate on the development of physical and environmental protection \n8policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization\nlevel are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies\nand procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or.\nbe represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures\ncan be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for\nsystems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can \n5be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events\nthat may precipitate an update to physical and environmental protection policy and procedures\ninclude assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply\nrestating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.",
