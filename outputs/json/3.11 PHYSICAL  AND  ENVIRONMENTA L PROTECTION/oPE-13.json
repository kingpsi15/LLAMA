  "PolicyName": "FIRE PROTECTION",
  "Control": "Employ and maintain fire detection and suppression systems that are supported by an independent energy source.",
  "Discussion": "The provision of fire detection and suppression systems applies primarily to 8 organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources, including data centers, Tserver rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Fire detection and suppression systems that may require an independent energy source include sprinkler systems and smoke detectors. An P independent energy source is an energy source, such as a microgrid, that is separate, or can be separated, from the energy sources providing power for the other parts of the facility.\nRelated Controls:  AT-3.\nControl Enhancements:\n|\u2014 (1) FIRE PROTECTION  DETECTION SYSTEMS  AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION AND NOTIFICATION\nAssignment: Employ fire detection systems that activate automatically and notify [organization-defined personnel or roles] and [emergency responders] in the event of a fire.\nDiscussion:  Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the classification or impact level of CHAPTER THREE   PAGE 188 NISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO EV ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.\nRelated Controls:  None.\n|\u2014 (2) FIRE PROTECTION  SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS  AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION AND NOTIFICATION\nAssignment: (a)Employ fire suppression systems that activate automatically and notify [organization-defined personnel or roles] and [emergency responders]; and (b)Employ an automatic fire suppression capability when the facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.\nDiscussion:  Organizations can identify specific personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have appropriate access authorizations and/or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the impact level or information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require classification of information within the facility.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nor (3) FIRE PROTECTION  AUTOMATIC FIRE SUPPRESSION [Withdrawn: Incorporated into PE-13(2).]\nl| (4) FIRE PROTECTION  INSPECTIONS\nAssignment: organization-defined frequencyEnsure that the facility undergoes [] fire protection inspections by authorized and qualified inspectors and identified deficiencies f hAssignment: organization-defined time periodare resolved within [].\nDiscussion:  Authorized and qualified personnel within the jurisdiction of the organization include state, county, and city fire inspectors and fire marshals. Organizations provide escorts during inspections in situations where the systems that reside within the facilities contain sensitive information.\nRelated Controls:  None.\nReferences:  None.",
