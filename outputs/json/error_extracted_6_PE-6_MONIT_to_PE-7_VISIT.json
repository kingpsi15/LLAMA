      "PolicyName": "MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS",
      "Control": "a.Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides to detect and respond to physical security incidents;\nb.Review physical access logs [] and upon\nAssignment: organization-defined events or potential indications of eventsoccurrence of []; h\nc.Coordinate results of reviews and investigations with the organizational incident response l ic capability.\t",
      "Discussion": "Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within organizational is\nfacilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video\nisurveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can la\nhelp identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be le\nfAU-2, if the access logs are part of an automated supported by audit logging controls, such as r\nsystem. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security\nincidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious c\nphysical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal\nwork hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of e\ntime, and out-of-sequence accesses.\n",
      "ControlEnhancements": "\n|  i(1) MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS  INTRUSION ALARMS AND SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT.\nMonitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using physical intrusion /\nalarms and surveillance equipment. .\n2Discussion:  Physical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when\nNunauthorized access to the facility is attempted. Alarm systems work in conjunction with\nphysical barriers, physical access control systems, and security guards by triggering a\nresponse when these other forms of security have been compromised or breached. Physical\nintrusion alarms can include different types of sensor devices, such as motion sensors, 8\n0contact sensors, and broken glass sensors. Surveillance equipment includes video cameras\ninstalled at strategic locations throughout the facility.\n3Discussion:  Response actions can include notifying selected organizational personnel or law\nenforcement personnel. Automated mechanisms implemented to initiate response actions\ninclude system alert notifications, email and text messages, and activating door locking\nmechanisms. Physical access monitoring can be coordinated with intrusion detection\nCHAPTER THREE   PAGE 184\nnISTSP800-53,R.5SPCISO                                                             EV                                                                                     ECURITY AND RIVACY ONTROLS FOR NFORMATION YSTEMS AND RGANIZATIONS_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________",
